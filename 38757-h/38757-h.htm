<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>During the many years that the compiler has had the
management of the publishing department of Messrs. Boericke
&amp; Tafel&mdash;long to look back over, yet short to live&mdash;so many
inquiries came in for "literature," or, in the form, "where
can I find something about" this, that, or the other, remedy,
that finally I became convinced that there might be a niche
in the great world's already over-crowded library for a book
containing, in part, at least, the information desired by my
numerous correspondents. This determined, and the great
publishing house willing to back the enterprise, came the
task of collecting the material. The work once begun, it
was soon found that it is much easier to plan such a volume
than to carry out the plan, for it involved no inconsiderable
amount of delving in dusty piles of old journals to discover
the sought for matter, which, when brought to light, had to
be scanned closely to determine whether it was of a nature to
justify this literary resurrection. However, in the odd hours
of time that could be bestowed the work was finally completed
and&mdash;the result is before you, kindly reader.</p>

<p>That this collection of papers has many gems is, I believe,
not to be questioned; that some better papers on the remedies
than those herein presented may exist is also probable; that
it may contain some that are of doubtful value is not to be
denied, and even some that have no right in such a book
may have crept in. But what it is, it is; take the good and,
in the current phrase of the hour, "forget" the rest.</p>

<p>The part born by the editor, beyond delving for and selecting
the remedies, will be found scattered through the book in<span class="pagenum">[Pg iv]</span>
bracketed small type, and consists simply in announcing who
the writer of the paper was and where it may be found; no
attempt has been made at editing any of the papers, or commenting
on them, beyond a little cutting out of a little
verbosity here and there, or of matter not bearing on the use
of the remedy.</p>

<p>The material was drawn from journals of all "schools,"
wherever a paper could be found that seemed to contain
something not to be found in medical-book literature, and to
be honestly written.</p>

<p>The new remedies of the laboratory have been purposely
ignored because they do not come in the scheme of this book,
they having a literature of their own that, not infrequently,
may be had "free on request" to the laboratories. Only
remedies (with a few exceptions) such as nature gives us are
included in this work.</p>

<p>And now the task completed naught remains but for the
compiler to subscribe himself,</p>

<h3>ACALYPHA INDICA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Euphorbiaceæ.<br />
<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Indian Acalypha, Indian Nettle.<br />
<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The fresh plant is macerated with two parts
by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. Tonnère, of Calcutta, India, seems to have been the first to call attention
to this plant as a remedy. In a small work, <i>Additions to the
Hom&#339;opathic Materia Medica</i>, collected and arranged by Henry Thomas,
M. D., and published in London in the year 1858, appears the following
credited to that physician.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Tincture of the <i>Acalypha Indica</i>, prepared and administered
in the sixth decimal dilution, is specific in hæmorrhage
from the lungs. In three cases in which I have employed it,
the persons were affected with phthisis. In one case there
was a tuberculous affection of the upper portion of the left
lung, of some two years' standing. Hæmoptysis had been
going on for three months; the expectoration had been in
the morning pure blood; in the evening dark lumps of
clotted blood, and the fits of coughing were very violent at
night. In this case all hom&#339;opathic remedies had been tried
unsuccessfully, when I accidentally discovered the virtues of
the <i>Acalypha Indica</i>, that remedy having been given me by a
native for jaundice. I prepared the mother tincture upon
the hom&#339;opathic principle, and took 10 drops, which brought
on a severe fit of dry cough, followed by spitting of blood.
Having noted all the symptoms experienced by myself, and
finding that they were nearly all similar to those of my
patients, I gave six drops 6th [decimal] dilution in half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
tumbler of water, a spoonful to be taken every half hour, beginning
immediately (9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>). At 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, the blood stopped.
I continued this for eight days, and the blood has never reappeared
(now three months since). The patient is improving,
and auscultation proves the disease has decreased, and I
am in hopes to affect a cure, yet one month since I have been
giving them the medicine they have not spit any blood, although
previously one of them never passed a day without
spitting a great quantity. <i>Calcarea carb.</i> is an antidote to the
<i>Acalypha</i>.</p>

<p>Another transatlantic medical friend writes:&mdash;"I hope you
obtained some of the <i>Acalypha Indica</i> while you were here.
I have found it perfectly successful in arresting hæmoptysis
in three cases of consumption in the last stage; I could not
perceive any other effect from its use, but the cessation of the
hemorrhagic sputa was, I think, a great advantage."</p>

<p>Its use in my hands has been very satisfactory, but I have
only tried it in similar cases to those already cited. The first
instance of my using it&mdash;in a hopeless case of phthisis&mdash;a
continued and wearisome hæmoptysis succumbed to its exhibition,
and quiet sleep succeeded its use&mdash;the patient eventually
died of pulmonary paralysis.</p>

<p>In a case of passive hæmorrhage from the lungs, after
<i>Arnica</i> was used with little benefit, <i>Acalypha</i> benefited, and
then failed; after which the use of <i>Arnica</i> entirely stayed
the hæmorrhagic flow. (Perhaps <i>Hamamelis</i> would have at
once cured, but it was not at hand.)<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>K., a phthisical patient, had hæmoptysis to a considerable
extent; in a short time his voice failed him; he took half-drop
doses of 7th [decimal] dilution of <i>Acalypha</i> in water
every half hour, and in a few hours the blood spitting left
him entirely.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In 1885 Dr. Peter Cooper, of Wilmington, Delaware, read a paper on the
drug <i>Acalypha Indica</i> of which the following is an abstract:)</p></blockquote>

<p>Professor Jones recapitulates as follows: "<i>Time.</i> Hæmor<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span>rhage
occurs in morning. <i>Blood.</i> Bright-red and not profuse
in morning; dark and clotted in afternoon. <i>Pulse.</i>
Neither quickened nor hard; rather soft and easily compressible.
<i>Cough.</i> Violent and in fits at night; patient has a
played-out feeling in the morning and gains in strength as
the day advances.</p>

<p><i>N. B.</i>&mdash;Worthy of trial in all pathological hæmorrhages
having notedly a morning exacerbation."</p>

<p>Such is an outline presentation of the drug given us by so
eminent an authority as Professor Jones, of the University of
Michigan. It was his "N. B.," his suggestion that <i>Acalypha</i>
was worthy of trial in all pathological hæmorrhages from
any source, providing the morning aggravation was present,
that fixed my attention upon the drug especially. At the
time I had a case of hæmorrhage per rectum that had baffled
me for several months. No remedy had aided the case in
the least, so far as I could see, unless it was Pond's Extract
used locally in the form of injection; and I finally came to
the conclusion that the relief apparently due to the <i>Hamamelis</i>
was merely a coincidence. I had given all the hæmorrhagic
remedies I knew of or could hear of. Still the
bleeding came just as often, with increasing severity. Each
time the patient was sure she would "bleed to death," and I
was not positive she would be disappointed. In fact, I was
so hopeless that I used to delay the answer to her summons
as long as possible, so that the bleeding might have time to
exhaust itself. She became reduced in flesh and the hæmorrhagic
drugs became reduced in number, until like the nine
little Indians sitting on a gate the last one tumbled off and
then there was none. As soon as I read Dr. Jones' monograph
on <i>Acalypha Indica</i>, I determined to try it. She had
all the symptoms&mdash;bright-red blood in the morning; dark
and clotted in the afternoon and evening; weak and languid
in the forenoon, stronger during the afternoon&mdash;except one,
<i>i.e.</i>, instead of the blood coming from the lungs it came
from within the portals of the anus. I procured the 6x dil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and served it in water. It gave speedy, almost immediate relief.
Each subsequent attack came less profuse and at longer
intervals. She has not had a hæmorrhage now for two
months, while before she was having from seven to one (continuous)
a week. She is gaining in flesh, is in every way
improved, and keeps <i>Acalypha Indica</i> constantly by her.</p>

<h3>ACIDUM LACTICUM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Lactic acid.<br />

<span class="smcap">Origin.</span>&mdash;Lactic acid is obtained from sour milk, resulting
from the fermentation of the sugar of milk under the influence
of casein.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation</span> <i>for Hom&#339;opathic Use</i>.&mdash;One part by weight of
pure lactic acid is dissolved in 99 parts by weight of alcohol.</p>


<blockquote><p>(A very complete proving of this remedy will be found in Allen's <i>Encyclopædia
of Pure Materia Medica</i>, but little use seems to have been made
of it, though the following by Dr. Tybel-Aschersleben, <i>Allgemeine Hom.
Zeitung</i>, March 13, 1890, seems to show that it is very efficient in certain
forms of rheumatism).</p></blockquote>

<p>We are by no means rich in remedies against arthritic rheumatism,
and those which we do use lack the reputation of
being reliable. A new and a valuable remedy will therefore
be a welcome addition to this list. I say reliable, inasmuch
as this remedy is truly hom&#339;opathically indicated for, according
to Foster, of Leitz, Niemeyer's Pathology, 10th
edition, 2d vol., pp. 561: "<i>Lactic acid in large doses and used
for a long time will produce symptoms entirely analogous to
arthritic rheumatism</i>." We also find mention elsewhere that
the use of lactic acid occasioned rheumatic pains in the
thigh.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clinical Cases.</span></p>

<p>1. A young girl æt. 15 was afflicted with acute arthritic
rheumatism, she received <i>Acid Lacticum</i> 2x dil., a dose every
2 or 3 hours, and was so much improved in two weeks that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the pain had subsided, and for her remaining weakness
<i>China off.</i> sufficed.</p>

<p>2. A nine-year-old girl was confined to her bed for three
weeks with acute arthritic rheumatism. <i>Acid Lacticum 2</i>
speedily cured her.</p>

<p>3. A miner, B., had been afflicted over six weeks with
acute arthritic rheumatism. The first dose of <i>Acid Lactic 2</i>
gave relief and a second dose cured the man.</p>

<p>4. In a case with swollen and very painful joints one dose
of <i>Acidum Lactic 2</i> sufficed to overcome the pain and the
swelling. Against the remaining weakness <i>China</i> proved
efficacious.</p>

<p>5. Arthritic rheumatism of the wrist vanished slowly after
using <i>Acid Lactic 2</i> from two to three weeks.</p>

<p>6. A patient afflicted with arthritic rheumatism for four
weeks, accompanied by copious perspiration, soon mended
under the use of <i>Acid Lactic 2</i> and was entirely cured within
two weeks.</p>

<p>7. Even in a case of chronic arthritis with inflation of the
Epiphyses of Metacarpal bones and consequent partial displacement
of the fingers, <i>Lactic Acid 2</i> produced such a decided
amelioration that two months later the report said: all
pains are gone even the anchylosis has disappeared.</p>

<blockquote><p>(It has also been successfully employed in cases where the digestive
powers are weak and is said to be preferable to other acids in such cases. It
has also been successfully employed in cases of dyspepsia.)</p></blockquote>

<h3>ÆTHIOPS ANTIMONIALIS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>(This remedy is prepared by triturating together equal parts of <i>Æthiops
mineralis</i> and <i>Antimonium crudum</i>; we may add that the first named consists
of a trituration of equal parts of <i>Mercurius viv.</i> and washed flowers of
sulphur. Therefore <i>Æthiops antimon.</i> consists of mercury, crude antimony
and sulphur.</p>

<p>The following clinical cases illustrating the use of the preparation is by
Dr. H. Goullon and was published in Vol. II of the <i>Zeitschrift fuer Hom&#339;opathie</i>:)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>The following case was cured in a few days by <i>Æthiops
antimonalis</i> after having been treated by a hom&#339;opath who
strictly followed Hahnemann's rules, but failed to make an
impression beyond a certain point.</p>

<p>Miss A. inherited from her father, who was reported to
have suffered from laryngitis, a distinct disposition to scrofulosis
and tuberculosis. This was proved two years ago by a
bloody cough caused by lung catarrh. After the lung was
affected she suffered from profuse sweats, especially down the
back, but of special interest was the appearance of a "quince
colored" swelling of the size of a pea at the extreme corner
of the left eye with suppuration which threatened the bulbus.
A skilled specialist removed by operation this pus-hearth,
which no doubt acted as a fontanel. The immediate result
was a large furuncle under the arm and the affliction for
which I was consulted. A patient presented herself to me
whose appearance was shocking. Numerous parts of her face
were literally covered with thick, elevated fissured scabs. A
scrofulent liquid was oozing out, and the worst were those
parts on the side of the lower lip, the nostrils and the root of
the nose. On the whole, a certain symmetry could be observed
in the arrangements of these frightful diseased products.</p>

<p>This eruption, which according to its nature must be called
herpetic-eczematous, had existed for five months. The patient,
who has red hair, and is between 20 and 30 years old, contracted
this disease at the sight of a fainting sister. This
kind of genesis is an established fact. I remember of reading
in Stark's "General Pathology" of an instance where a
mother was affected with eczema of the lips immediately on
seeing her child fall on a knife.</p>

<p>Our patient, however, lost the above mentioned sweats,
which proves that the fright had a metastatic effect. I learned
that at first there appeared very small spots which developed
into pustules, infecting half of the forehead. Scratching ag<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>gravated
the condition, so that some places assumed a cup-like
appearance, somewhat as favus.</p>

<p>When patient came to me the face was oozing so terribly
that the pillow was thoroughly soaked in the morning, and
she suffered greatly. When asked the nature of the pains
she said that they were sometimes itching, sometimes tensive,
and often indescribable, suddenly appearing and disappearing.</p>

<p>What should be done? Certainly no strictly hom&#339;opathic
indication presented itself since one might think of <i>Sulphur</i>,
another of <i>Arsenicum</i>, <i>Silicea</i>, <i>Hepar sulphur</i>, <i>Causticum</i>,
<i>Mezereum</i>, etc. In such case I have laid down, as a rule for
my guidance, never to experiment at the cost of the patient
(and my own as well as Hahnemann's), but to employ a so-called
empirical remedy. I know <i>Æthiops antimonialis</i> as a
very effective remedy through its recommendation (by the
Berlin Society of Hom&#339;opathic Physicians) in ophthalmia
scrofulosa of the worst kind, a fact which I proved myself to
be correct. In this case, also, we find the deepest and most
stubborn disturbance of the organic juices and a subject with
every indication of the worst form of scrofula, ending in
lethal cancer&mdash;dyscrasia or tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The patient received the remedy in doses of the 1st centesimal
trituration, every evening and morning, as much as a
point of a knife blade would hold. There was no attempt at
external removal of the eruption, a method so much favored
by the allopaths, and yet the simple internal effort was magical,
since after a few days the scabs were dried up, had fallen
off, and the terrible oozing as well as the pain had ceased.
The happy patient presented herself again on Friday, after
having taken the medicine for the first time on Sunday evening.
Very great changes could, indeed, be noticed which
justified the hope for a speedy and total cure.</p>

<p>I again ask all my colleagues which was the principle of
healing in this case? We may soonest think of Schüssler's
therapeutic maxim, the biochemic principle. The definition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
that this preparation acts as a blood purifier is not sufficient,
and yet it may be accepted as the most intelligent.</p>

<p>Schoeman triturates the <i>Æthiops antimonalis</i> with <i>Æthiops
mercurialis</i> (or <i>mineralis</i>), which last consists of equal parts
of quicksilver and sulphur, and says of the product: "It
acts analogous to <i>Æthiops mercurialis</i>, but stronger, and is
therefore preferred to it in scrofulous eruptions of the skin,
scald, milk-scab, scrofulosis conjunctivitis, keratitis, blepharitis
glandulosa, otorrh&#339;a and swellings of the glands. It is
especially valuable for children as a mild but nevertheless
effective remedy."</p>

<h3>AGAVE AMERICANA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Amaryllidaceæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Common Names</span>, American Aloe, Maguey, Century Plant.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The fresh leaves are pounded to a pulp and
macerated with two parts by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(We find the following concerning this little known remedy in Volume I,
1851, of the <i>North American Journal of Hom&#339;opathy</i>.)</p></blockquote>

<p>1. <i>Agave Americana or Maguey.</i>&mdash;[Dr. Perin, U. S. A.,
stationed at Fort McIntosh, in Texas, having many cases of
scurvy to treat, and finding the usual allopathic routine ineffectual,
was led to make inquiry as to the domestic remedies
in use among the natives. Among others, his attention was
called to the <i>Agave Americana</i> or <i>American Aloe</i>, and he reports
to the Surgeon General the following cases in which it
was the drug relied on. We extract from the <i>N. Y. Jour.
Med.</i>:]</p>

<p>Private Turby, of Company "G," 1st U. S. Infantry, was
admitted into hospital March 25th, in the following state:
Countenance pale and dejected; gums swollen and bleeding;
left leg, from ankle joint to groin, covered with dark purple
blotches; leg swollen, painful, and of stony hardness;
pulse small, feeble; appetite poor; bowels constipated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>He was placed upon lime juice, diluted and sweetened, so
as to make an agreeable drink, in as large quantities as his
stomach would bear; diet generous as could be procured,
consisting of fresh meat, milk, eggs, etc.; vegetables could
not be procured.</p>

<p>April 11th. His condition was but slightly improved;
he was then placed upon the expressed juice of the maguey,
in doses of f. &#495;ij. three times daily; same diet continued.</p>

<p>April 17th. Countenance no longer dejected, but bright
and cheerful; purple spots almost entirely disappeared;
arose from his bed and walked across the hospital unassisted;
medicine continued.</p>

<p>May 4th. So much improved so as to be able to return
to his company quarters, where he is accordingly sent;
medicine continued.</p>

<p>May 7th. Almost entirely well; continued medicine.</p>

<p>Private Hood, "G" Company, 1st U. S. Infantry, was admitted
into hospital April 10th. His general condition did
not differ much from Private Turby's. He had been on
the sick report for eight days; had been taking citric acid
drinks, but grew gradually worse up to the time of his admission,
when he was placed upon lime-juice until the 13th,
at which time no perceptible change had taken place. On
that date he commenced the use of the expressed juice of
the maguey; same diet as the case above described.</p>

<p>April 21st. General state so much improved that he was
sent to his company quarters.</p>

<p>May 22d. Well; returned to duty.</p>

<p>Eleven cases, all milder in form than the two just related,
were continued upon the lime-juice; diet the same. On
the 21st of April they exhibited evidences of improvement,
but it was nothing when compared with the cases under
the use of the maguey.</p>

<p>Seven cases were under treatment during the same time,
making use of citric acid. On the 21st of April no one
had improved, and three were growing worse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>At this time so convinced was I of the great superiority
of the maguey over either of the other remedies employed
that I determined to place all the patients upon that medicine.
The result has proved exceedingly gratifying; every
case has improved rapidly from that date. The countenance,
so universally dejected and despairing in the patients affected
with scurvy, is brightened up by contentment and hope in
two days from the time of its introduction; the most
marked evidences of improvement were observable at every
successive visit. From observing the effects of the maguey
in the cases which have occurred in this command, I am
compelled to place it far above that remedy which, till now,
has stood above every other&mdash;the lime-juice.</p>

<p>This no doubt will appear strong language, but further
experience will verify it.</p>

<p>The juice of the maguey contains a large amount of
vegetable and saccharine matter, and of itself is sufficiently
nutritious to sustain a patient for days.</p>

<p>This succulent plant grows indigenous in most parts of
the State, and, if I am correctly informed, in New Mexico
and California. In Mexico it is well-known as the plant
from which they manufacture their favorite drink, the
"Pulque," and grows in great abundance. As it delights in
a dry sandy soil, it can be cultivated where nothing but the
cactus will grow; for this reason, it will be found invaluable
to the army at many of the western posts, where vegetables
cannot be procured.</p>

<p>The manner in which it is used is as follows, viz.:&mdash;The
leaves are cut off close to the root, they are placed in
hot ashes until thoroughly cooked, when they are removed,
and the juice expressed from them. The expressed juice is
then strained, and may be used thus, or may be sweetened.
It may be given in doses of f. &#495;ij. to f. &#495;iij. three times daily.</p>

<p>It is not disagreeable to take, and in every instance it has
proved to agree well with the stomach and bowels.</p>

<p>After the leaves have been cooked, the cortical portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
near the root may be removed, and the white internal portion
may be eaten; it appears to be a wholesome and nutritious
food. I have seen muleteers use it in this way, and
they seem to be very fond of it. I have been informed,
upon good authority, that several tribes of Indians in New
Mexico make use of it in the same manner. The use of
the leaf in this way, I believe, will ward off most effectually
incipient scorbutus.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In El Siglo Medico, 1890, Dr. Fernandez Avila reports the case of a boy,
æt. 8, who had been bitten by a supposedly mad dog on Feb. 18. The
wound healed up, but on July 7th the boy developed all the symptoms of
rabies and on the 17th was so violent that he had to be tied and had not
tasted food for seventy-two hours as all remedies failed to produce any effect,
the doctor, having read that <i>Agave Americana</i> was efficacious in such cases,
and having none of the tincture at hand, gave the boy a piece of the plant
itself which he greedily ate; it was given to him as long as he would take
it. On the 25th his symptoms had all abated and he was dismissed cured.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Of late years much attention has been called to the species
of the genus Ambrosia (the Rag Weeds) as being, through
the agency of their pollen, the cause of hay fever. Many
people afflicted with this troublesome complaint lay the charge
directly at its doors, while others claim that, in all probability,
it is the direct cause, as their sufferings always commence
during the anthesis of the plant. The general impression,
however, both among the laity and the medical fraternity, has
been that the effect was a purely mechanical one, the nasal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
mucous membranes being directly irritated by the pollen dust
in substance. If this were true, would not every one suffer
from hay fever? Impressed with the above report, I had the
pleasure of curing two attacks while writing my work upon
"American Medicinal Plants," in which the above species
figures. Since the publication of the work, all the cases I
have had of the disease (four) have yielded beautifully to the
3d centesimal potency of the drug.</p>

<p>The four cases, Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, Mrs. I&mdash;&mdash;, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; and
Miss P&mdash;&mdash;, presented the following generic symptoms: Inflammation
of the mucous membranes of the nose, adventing
yearly in the autumn. At first dryness, then watery discharges,
finally involving the frontal sinuses and the conjunctival
membrane. In Mr. B. and Miss P. the irritation
extended to the trachea and bronchial tubes, in Mr. B. amounting
to severe asthmatic attacks. In all cases the coryza
was very severe, and in previous years lasted, in spite of all
treatment, from four to eight weeks. Mr. B. has found relief
from <i>Ambrosia</i> &#658;&#8321;, three times a day, in from four to six days,
for three successive years, with no return of the trouble in
the same year; Mrs. I. has been relieved in from two to four
days for two years; Mr. C. gets immediate relief in twenty-four
hours (three seasons); Miss P., in this her first experience
with <i>Ambrosia</i>, found entire relief from six doses.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Outside the old herbalists the virtues of the bark and leaves of the peach
tree have received little attention. The following contributed by Dr. C. C.
Edson in the <i>Chicago Medical Times</i>, 1890, however, aroused some attention):</p></blockquote>

<p>Some ten years ago I had a little patient whose principle
difficulty seemed to be an inability to retain anything whatever
upon its stomach. It would vomit up promptly everything
I gave it, and I had given it everything I had ever
heard of and also had eminent council, but it was no go; I
was literally at my rope's end. At this juncture an elderly
lady neighbor, one of "the good old mothers," timidly suggested
an infusion of peach bark. Well, as it was any port
in storm, I started to find the coveted bark, which I was
fortunate enough to procure after a long tramp through the
country and two feet of snow. I prepared an infusion, gave
the little patient a few swallows, and presto! the deed was
done, the child cured. * * It fills all the indications of
the leaves and many more. It fills the indications of hydrocyanic
acid, ingluvin, ipecac or any other anti-emetic. It
will more frequently allay the vomiting of pregnancy than any
remedy I have ever tried. And nearly every case of retching
or vomiting (except it be reflex) will promptly yield under
its use. * * * For an adult the dose is five drops, and in
urgent cases repeat every five to ten minutes until the symptoms
subside, after which give it at intervals of one to four
hours as indicated. After ten years' use I am thoroughly convinced
that any physician once giving it a thorough trial will
never again be without it. Of course it is not a specific for
all "upheavals of the inner man," but will I think meet
more indications than any other known remedy of its class.</p>

<blockquote><p>(This brought out the following from Dr. Kirkpatrick in the same journal):</p></blockquote>

<p>I must say that I feel a little plagued after reading what
Dr. Edson says about <i>Amygdalus</i>; he has taken the wind out
of my sails, but I must give my experience. Quite a number
of years since a good friend in the profession called on me,
and asked me to visit one of his patients, honestly stating<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
that he thought she would die. I went a few miles in the
country to see her. She had been vomiting blood for two or
three days, and, notwithstanding she had had oxalate of
cerium, bismuth, pepsin, ingluvin and other good remedies,
everything she swallowed would come up, so that she looked
more like a corpse than a living being. I ordered them to
go out and get me some of the young switches of the last
year's growth from the peach tree; I had them pound them
to loosen the bark; I then nearly filled a tumbler with this
bark, then covered it with water. I ordered her a teaspoonful
to be taken after each time she vomited, one dose being
given then, and one every hour after the vomiting stopped.
The result was, she vomited no more and made a good recovery.</p>

<p>* * * In recent cases I have very rarely had to give
the second prescription to relieve morning sickness. I was
visiting a doctor in Quincy; while there he told me he was
afraid he would have either to make a lady abort or let her
die, from the fact that he had failed to stop her vomiting. I
happened to have a sample of the medicine with me; I gave
it to him, he took it to the lady and in a few days he reported
her well. I may say, like Dr. Edson, it is a standard remedy
with me. I have found it very useful in hæmorrhage from
the bladder. Some of my lady patients find it very good in
nervous headache. I have used the tincture prepared from
the leaves, but it is far inferior to that prepared from the
bark of the young shoots. A medical friend was going to
see a lady who had morning sickness; he told me he had
thought of advising her to use popcorn; I handed him a
small bottle of my <i>Amygdalus</i> and told him to take a couple
of ears of corn in his pocket and try both. The next time
I met him he said my medicine had done the work.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. Oliver S. Haines, of Philadelphia, also contributed the following
experience):</p></blockquote>

<p>Apropos of the remarks made by Dr. C. C. Edson upon
the efficacy of infusion of peach <i>bark</i> in the gastric irrita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>bility
of children, we might mention the following authentic
case:</p>

<p>An infant, during its second summer, had been much reduced
by acute dyspeptic diarrh&#339;a. A marked feature of
this case was the persistent vomiting of all food. The
stomach would tolerate no form of baby food with or without
milk. The child's parents had consulted some eminent physicians
of our city. The child had been treated hom&#339;opathically.
None of the remedies chosen seemed to produce
the desired effect. After a consultation it was deemed
best to send the infant to the mountains. The change aggravated
its condition. While the parents hourly expected
their baby would die, it was suggested that they send for an
old practitioner living in the mountains near at hand. This
man had a local reputation as a saver of dying babies. His
prescription was as follows: Two or three fresh peach <i>leaves</i>
were to be put in a cup of boiling water, the infant to receive
a "drink" of this infusion at frequent intervals. The
effects of this remedy were as remarkable in this case as
in the case narrated by Dr. Edson. Our child soon retained
food and eventually recovered.</p>

<p>It seems this ancient disciple of Esculapius had long used
peach leaves and regarded them as possessing specific
virtues.</p>

<h3>ARSENICUM BROMATUM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Names</span>, Arsenous or Arsenious Bromide; Arsenic
Tribromide.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Add one drachm each Arsenious acid, Carbonate
of Potassium and Tartar to eight ounces of Distilled
Water; boil until entirely dissolved; after cooling add sufficient
water to make eight ounces. Then add two drachms of pure
Bromine. <i>Clemens.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>(The following paper was translated, 1888, from the German (<i>Deutsche
Clinic</i>, March, 1859) of Dr. Th. Clemens, by the late Dr. Samuel Lilienthal):</p></blockquote>

<p>Arsenious acid, Arsenic blanc, Arsenic oxide, Flowers of
Arsenic (AsO<sub>3</sub>) is commonly used as the only preparation in
which it could be assimilated. In the Solutio Fowleri we find
a combination with Kali carbonicum e Tartaro, a combination
which allows to the Arsenious acid its full destructive power.
Now comes Spiritus Angelicæ comp. and the pure chemical
preparation smells like Theriac, but it ought hardly ever be
allowed to add something to a pure chemical preparation
in order to give it taste, color, and use. This Spir. Angel.
comp. is made up of Anglica, Siordium, Juniper berries,
Valerian, Camphor, and Alcohol, and Solutio Fowleri is prepared
even to this day in the same manner, and ought therefore
be expelled from every pharmacop&#339;ia, especially as it is
sure to spoil in the pharmacies if kept too long on the
shelves. Looking, therefore, for a better preparation, I prescribe
now for the last decade: <b>&#8478;</b>. Arsen. albi. depurat. pulv.,
Kali carb. e Tartar. &#257;&#257; &#658;j., coque cum Aqua destill. lb 1/2 ad
perfect. solutionem, refriger., adde aqua destil. q. s. ut fiat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
solutio &#495;xii., Dein adde Brom. pur. &#658;ii. This solution, which
during first eight days is frequently shaken, becomes colorless
in the fourth week, and is then ready for use. It must be
kept in a dark, cool place.</p>

<p>I will now give my reason for choosing Bromine as a combination.
The study of mineral waters is an old pet of mine;
many of them contain Arsenic in combination with Bromine,
and are all well known for their roborating and alterating
qualities. I begun, therefore, my experiments with minute
doses of <i>Brom. arsen.</i>; gradually these were increased, and I
felt astonished what large doses were well borne, and how
long I could use this preparation without injurious consequences.
After a few drops of my solution I could prove
Arsenic in all secretions, an experiment easily made by
Marsh's test. Experiments on animals with toxic doses of
either solution (Clemens and Fowler) showed that the same
quantity <i>Arsenicum brom.</i> is less poisonous (one has to be
careful with the selection of animals, as many of them, especially
ruminants, bear very large doses of Arsenic without
injury). My preparation gives a rapid, not destructive, but
roborating action on every part of the body.</p>

<p>In doses of two to four drops daily, always to be taken in
a full glass of water, it always shows its specific action as an
antipsoricum. Herpetic eruptions and syphilitic excrescences
or exanthemata dry up and heal up, while simultaneously the
relaxed and thoroughly infected body steadily increases in
turgor vitals. Glandular tumors and indurations of dyscrasic
origin, where any other treatment has failed, are scattered by
the long-continued use of my preparation. I have in suitable
cases given it for years without noticing any hurtful sequelæ,
and after my patients were cured I kept them under observation
for years afterwards, and know, therefore, that nothing
injurious followed. This cannot be said of the usual arsenical
preparations, and old Heim, a great admirer of Arsenic, opposed
a lengthy use of it; he rather preferred larger doses,
which is rather a dangerous procedure. Given for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
time for carcinoma, it stops the rapid progress of this fearful
disease, and though at the same time Chloride of arsenic was
used externally, a real cure remained an impossibility. My
best successes were in obstinate cases of lues inveterata, in
the first stages of tabes dorsalis (ataxie locomotrice), in the
reconvalescence from exhausting acute diseases, in gastric
suppurations, inactivity of bowels, tardy digestion, constipation.
In cases where <i>Chininum sulph.</i> failed in intermittent
fevers, I prescribe <i>Brom. arsen.</i> twice daily, four drops, each
time in a full glass of water, gradually diminishing it to one
daily dose, and in four weeks even the most obstinate cases
yielded to this treatment. The patient feels encouraged by
his increasing vigor, the fever-cakes disappear, the bowels
move regularly, and appetite leaves nothing to be desired.
Those mean obstinate cases of intermittens larvata, often appearing
in the form of unbearable neuralgiæ, yield more
rapidly to it than to the Quinine. It is often quite astonishing
what good results can be obtained by the daily use of
only one drop of this solution, kept up for a very long time
in dyscrasic constitutions, who spent a fortune to regain their
health and failed with every other treatment. Its full solubility
and rapid assimilation are the reason that it can be
used without injury, but it must be taken largely diluted.
Let me give you a few cases for elucidation.</p>

<p>St., 46 years old, contracted syphilis several years ago and
was relieved of it by mercurial treatment and Zittman's decoction.
About six years ago he felt out of sorts, and a papular
eruption appeared on forehead, temples, and especially
at the root of the nose. Though treatment was immediately
instituted, still in a few weeks the face of the patient was covered
by an ugly, foul-smelling crust. Cod-liver oil was now
taken internally, and applied externally till the scuffs fell off
and the eruption concentrated on three points. For six
months that treatment was kept up, but after being omitted
for a few weeks, the eruption spread again to its former extent.
Every treatment was tried in rotation without the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
benefit. In the spring 1856 he entered my clinic. In the
centre of the forehead, at the root of the nose, on both eyebrows,
on the temples and right cheek there are moist herpetic
eruptions covered with crusts, exuding on least pressure
an acrid ichor and easily bleeding. Around these eruptions
the skin is injected, reddened, interspersed with a large network
of veins. Cough and expectoration hint to a beginning
of tuberculosis, an heirloom in the family. Little appetite,
disturbed digestion, tardy defecation, and evening fever.
He is ordered Solutio arsen. brom. twice a day, four drops in
a glass of water, and already after two weeks the eruption
begins to dry up, appetite returns, and bowels are regular.
A generous diet and fresh meat several times a day are accessories
to an arsenical cure. After two months two crusts fall
off and the skin under them is soft, shining, somewhat red.
About July all eruption had gone, and the cough greatly improved.
A few months ago I saw the patient again, and I
feel sure that the disease is eradicated.</p>

<p>Miss W., 42 years old, passed her childhood in the West
Indies, and brought from there a peculiar skin disease. When
I saw her for the first time her features looked old for her
age, skin gray and sallow, hair gray, rough, full of dandruff,
and moisture oozing from the ears and forehead. The scalp
feels hard and thickened. The cervical glands are indurated
all around the neck. On the left chest an herpetic eruption
of the size of a dollar, and on the mamma a hard tumor of
the size of a fist. For a year past this tumor began to be
painful and sensitive to pressure, and my advice was sought
for relief of all her ailments, especially as her hands were
also in a fearful state, where the eruption looked as if she
had the itch. The nails were discolored, knobby, easily
bleeding and covered with a gluey eruption. She had to
wear and to change gloves every day. For nine years she
never entered society, as the exhalation from her body disgusted
even herself, and was hardly bearable, though sponging
the whole body and daily renewal of linen was strictly<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
adhered to. In such an obstinate chronic psoric case treatment
with small doses is at first necessary, and <i>Arsen. brom.</i>,
two drops twice daily, ordered, and her cold bath continued.
After four weeks the dose was doubled, and after nine weeks
the first glimmer of improvement could be seen. The tumor
in the mamma was smaller and painless, and where before it
was so sensitive as to be covered with oil-silk she could bear
now the pressure of her clothing. After four months steady
continuation of four drops twice daily, she was able to go
without gloves. The scalp also was cleaner, less hard, and
the ears more dry. But with the return of spring the eruption
gained new vigor. The head and hands became covered
with suppurating nodules and small exuding herpetic spots,
which became confluent and itched terribly, a most classic
picture of the herpes of the ancients. Though for years she had
been accustomed to an aggravation in the spring, she never witnessed
it in such severity. I now omitted the drug and ordered
head and hands frequently washed with cold water. After
eight days the storm calmed down, and it was remarkable to
witness the steady decrease of the induration in the cervical
glands and mamma. After four weeks the old treatment was
renewed. During the summer months she took regularly
her four drops twice daily, and in the beginning of autumn
the dose was reduced to two drops, and so continued during
the whole winter. The following spring crisis was the mildest
one she ever experienced. During the summer she took
her four drops, during fall and winter two drops. The third
spring aggravation came with full severity, but lasted only
three days, when desquamation followed. Another year of
the same treatment and the fourth spring eruption showed itself
slightly only in small papules behind the ears and between
the fingers, and were hardly worth noticing. She now
felt a slight weakness in right arm, which from childhood up
was rather weaker than the other one. After the disappearance
of the induration in the mamma the arm seemed to regain
its former strength and the patient felt therefore rather<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
astonished at the reappearance of the weakness when its
cause seemed removed, but it yielded readily to a mild constant
current applied a few times, and some faradic shocks
each time from the shoulder through the arm, and in September
she went to Nizza in order to use sea-bathing, with
the advice to take for a whole year one drop daily of her
solution. She considered herself now well, but still her skin
was flabby, especially on the hands where the epidermis often
desquamated, and the nails remained hard, brittle and without
lustre.</p>

<p>I may here remark that I found repeatedly Arsenic in the
urine of such patients. A case of obstinate intermittens
larvata, characterized by vomiting of chyme, also yielded to
<i>Arsen. brom.</i> One case more must suffice. A young man
went to America but failed in his trade, and became barkeeper
on a Mississippi steamer, which place he had to give
up on account of intermittent fever. We find him then as
hostler in Chicago where he was laid up with an attack of
cholera, and as he did not fully recover his strength he returned
to the old home again. When I saw him for the first
time the diagnosis seemed to be first stage of Bright's disease.
Anamnesis, ætiology, and present state, albumen in
the urine, justified the diagnosis. Patient is pale, bloated,
&#339;dema pedum, no appetite, white tongue, thin feverish pulse,
swollen spleen, watery diarrh&#339;a alternating with constipation.
Every drug produced vomiting, and he perfectly abhorred
the old Quinine powders. I ordered four drops <i>Arsen.
brom.</i> and a full meat diet. Improvement followed with the
continuance of the treatment. After three weeks the spleen
was reduced in size, his face showed better color, hardly any
&#339;dema. To strengthen the skin he was advised to take pineneedle
baths, and after three months' treatment he could be
discharged, a well man. He was advised to take for a few
months one drop daily of his solution, and to take often an
airing in the pineries which abound around Frankfort.
Though he returned to America the latest reports from him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
are that he feels again as well as ever, but he keeps his drops
about him.</p>

<p><i>Arsen. brom.</i> is also a powerful remedy in diabetes mellitus
and insipidus, for I cured cases with it where the patient had
already been reduced from 138 pounds to 98, and where the
urine could be condensed, by boiling, into syrupy consistency.
Mixed diet may be allowed, though I insist upon large quantities
of fresh meat during treatment with <i>Bromide of arsenic</i>.
Let the patient take three drops thrice daily in a glass of
water, and after a week the insatiable burning thirst will be
quenched, and these doses must be continued till the quantity
of sugar in the urine is reduced, when the drug might
be taken twice a day and continued for a long time. A diabetic
patient needs fresh pure air if he wishes to get well;
confinement in a room or in the office prevents the action of
any treatment, for it needs ozone to reduce the sugar of the
blood into carbonic acid and water.</p>

<h3>AURUM MURIATICUM NATRONATUM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Name.</span>&mdash;Chloride of Gold and Sodium.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;A mixture composed of equal parts of dry
chloride of Gold and chloride of Sodium, triturated in the usual
way.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following is an extract from a paper by Dr. H. Goullon in the <i>Allg.
Hom. Zeit.</i>, bd. 114, No. 12, on the therapeutics of this remedy):</p></blockquote>

<p>Never have I observed gold so startling in its action as in
the following case: The patient is a type of the scrofulous
habit; reddish hair, pasty complexion, thick nose, coarse
features. About thirty years of age. He has had the misfortune
of being infected by syphilis, and the still greater ill-luck
of being treated by mercurial inunctions and iodine to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>
excess. All these circumstances conjoined helped to produce
a complication of morbid conditions which would put medical
art to a severe test. Let us recall the region in which gold
makes such brilliant cures, and we find it especially suitable
in an uncommon swelling of the left testicle. In this case I
do not exaggerate, when I say that the scrotum was as large
as a gourd of moderate size and the tumor was four or five
times larger in circumference than the right testicle, which
was also swollen. The entire mass simulated an oblong,
heavy weight, like those one meets with in old-fashioned
clocks, and could hardly find space in the capacious suspensory.</p>

<p>The skin was also involved. On the elbow was a wide-spread
herpetic eruption; on different parts of the body were
gummy indurations; the ear discharged; in short, the many
characteristic manifestations of the syphilitic poison were to
be seen throughout the cutaneous and mucous systems. There
were also ulcerous formations in the oral cavity and on the
sides of the tongue.</p>

<p>After about four weeks the patient again set foot upon
the floor, saying: 'The drops have done wonders.' And indeed
the influence upon the testicles was so striking that now
the right, which was formerly the smaller, seemed the larger,
without having actually at all increased in size. Not the less
remarkable had been the action of gold on the general condition.
The patient, formerly irritable and uneasy, is cheerful
and comfortable; enjoys sound sleep, whereas before he
was disturbed with morbid dreams; has lost his previous
debility and disgust for everything; and says that his digestive
power is quite a different thing. He assimilates articles
of diet which he did not formerly dare to take, unless he
wished to suffer with flatulence, gastric acidity and vomiting.
Among other things punch, which he 'could not even smell,'
agrees well.</p>

<p>But, evidently, the mode of administering gold in such
cases is not a matter of indifference. And although I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
only recently published a cure with high potencies (in which
I subsequently corrected the mistake of the 100th <i>Dec.</i> for the
<i>Centes.</i>, which was what I used of the <i>Natrum muriaticum</i>),
I cannot commit myself to high potencies in syphilitic complications.
Experience in these cases is always in favor of
substantial doses. But, as we shall soon see, these proportionally
massive and heavy doses are always quite out of the
allopathic posological range, and even on this ground one
must set boundaries, and seek for the conversion of the traditional
school. By two or three clinical experiences of this
sort many a Saul would become a Paul in spite of all former
prejudices, <i>vis inertia</i>, and most tormenting skepticism. One-half
grain <i>Aurum muriaticum natronatum</i> was dissolved in
6 grms. Spiritus vini, but of this first 6 drops are again put
into a wineglass of water, of which the patient takes a teaspoonful
thrice daily.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. Tritschler, of the Gynæcological Clinic of Tübingen, furnishes the following
on the use of this remedy in diseases of women. From <i>Allg. Hom.
Zeit.</i>, bd. 94. Nos. 17. 18, 19):</p></blockquote>

<p>Permit me now to specify some practical instances of the
curative powers of <i>Aurum</i>, and especially of <i>Aurum muriaticum
natronatum</i>, in reference to gynæcology.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chronic Metritis.</span></p>

<p>The first case is that of a woman with chronic metritis and
prolapsus uteri. Hydrarg. chlorat. mit. was given at first,
which acted favorably on the inflammation, but whose further
use was prevented by its giving rise to salivation. The intumescence
of the uterus continued about the same. Chloride
of gold entirely reduced the chronic inflammation, and restored
the uterus to its natural position without external
means.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Induration of Uterus.</span></p>

<p>The second case was an unmarried woman at the climacteric,
the vaginal portion of whose uterus showed an induration
which disappeared during the administration of chloride
of gold.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><span class="smcap">Hysterical Spasms.</span></p>

<p>The third case was a woman with periodical attacks of
hysterical spasms, which involved the entire body, with unconsciousness
lasting several hours, asthma, palpitation, etc.,
beginning with a sense of coldness, ascending from the abdomen,
and perceptible even to the bystanders. Sometimes
the attack began with pulsation through the occiput. Examination
showed an inflamed uterus, filling not only the
true pelvis, and interfering with urination and defecation,
but the enlarged uterus perceptible through the thick abdominal
walls above the pubes. At the end of seven months,
<i>Aur. mur. nat.</i> had entirely reduced the swelling. The
woman has enjoyed good health for several years, quite free
from the so-called hysteria.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Induration of Cervix.</span></p>

<p>It happened that a woman presented an induration of the
cervix, together with a remarkable softening in the posterior
uterine wall. The result of treatment with chloride of gold
was, that in proportion to the decrease of the induration
there was an increase in the consistency of the softened
posterior wall. The woman, who had been married for three
years and childless, became pregnant for the first time and
has since borne several children. With this experience, the
Gold-chloride was also given for a softening of the atrophied
cervical canal, in one case until it was curved at right angles
to the body of the uterus; also in a diffused softening of the
uterine tissues, with the result that the hitherto sterile
woman, after toning up the uterine tissue, attained the joy of
motherhood. * * * * *</p>

<p>Habitual abortion and premature labor recurring at about
the same month of pregnancy generally depended upon induration
in some portion of the uterus, which, preventing its
natural expansion during gestation, gives rise to premature
expulsion of the f&#339;tus. By the use of <i>Aur. mur. nat.</i> before<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>
and during pregnancy, the absorption of this induration will
conduce to the proper termination of parturition.</p>

<p>A swelling of the ovary, reaching as far as the umbilicus,
I have cured with <i>Aur. mur. nat.</i>, and have improved others
of considerable extent very decidedly. Martini has cured five
cases of ovarian dropsy in the greatest possible degree with
the same remedy.</p>

<p>Ulcers of the os and the vaginal portion, which had resulted
from inflammation and induration, some as large as a dollar,
and of a gangrenous character, were healed by the use of gold,
without any topical applications.</p>

<p>The profession considers ulceration and induration of the
uterus incurable. This dogma of theirs is based on the fact
that the usual change, the disturbance of nutrition, can
neither be remedied nor hindered in its advance. Now since
ulcers are generally found only in an advanced stage of softening
and induration, it is conceivable why the school&mdash;seeking
a cure solely in the use of local means&mdash;turns away almost
entirely from the employment of internal remedies. According
to the opinions of the specialists the use of different
remedies, partly insoluble, partly soluble, pure or in combination,
permanent or transient, is indicated. Others apply ointments
on sponges to the surface of the ulcers, keeping them
in contact with it by tampons. Others again prescribe injections,
and with these expect to attain the end. Finally, glowing-hot
iron, the galvano-cautery, or the knife and scissors remove
partially or entirely the vaginal portion.</p>

<p>Now, if the malady continues to thrive on the wounds
made by these procedures, if old cicatrices break out again,
if too a permanent cure is out of the question, there is ground
for supposing that the <i>product</i> of illness, the ulcer, may be
cauterized, burnt and cut away, but that the cause, the diathesis,
the tendency to it, can only be removed by internal
medication. * * * * *</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span><span class="smcap">Chronic Metritis.</span></p>

<p>One day an official in Dresden brought his wife to me, who
was 41 years of age. The couple, all of whose children had
died soon after birth, longed once more for children. The
woman had aborted several times, and both were intelligent
enough to see that everything could not be right with the
sexual organs, and even begged for a gynæcological examination.
The result was in a few words: inflammation of both
lips of the uterus, a thickening of the cervical canal with a
swelling of the posterior uterine wall as hard as cartilage,
and retroversio uteri. Menstruation too early, dysmenorrh&#339;a,
blood dark, tarry, passing in clots. Yellowish, fetid
leucorrh&#339;a. Stools retained, appetite changeable; pains in
the broad ligaments on both sides during rest as well as on
exertion. The so-called "facies uterina"&mdash;weeps much. Frequent
exclamations on the distastefulness of life since the
death of all her children, and on account of her present childlessness.
Should I register in my journal in the beginning
of a scirrhus? I wrote simply: metritis chronica; intumescentia
labiorum orificii et colli uteri.</p>

<p>Prognosis, not unfavorable as far as regards the swelling,
after my already well-tested experience with <i>Aur. mur. nat.</i>
But how about the removal of sterility acquired in her 41st
year. I was more cautious about this. The cure took six
months, and was not only accompanied by absorption of the
affected parts, but the woman became pregnant in good time
and gave birth to a boy with comparative comfort. Thus
would the wishes of the worthy couple have been fulfilled, if
their joy had not been banished once more by the death of the
child in four weeks from an attack of eclampsia.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anteversion With Prolapsus.</span></p>

<p>I now come in conclusion to a gratifying case, which I relate
partly because we make ourselves guilty of sins of
omission in certain instances through neglect of the needful
investigation. A woman in her twentieth year, quite healthy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
had been delivered with forceps for the first time two years
before, nominally on account of deficient labor pains. There
was nothing unusual about the confinement. Immediately
after the first getting up, she began to have constant pain in
the right side of the uterine region, and soon a feeling "as if
something would fall out of the parts." The family physician
paid no attention to these persistent complaints for a
whole year, until finally a constantly increasing leucorrh&#339;a
demanded an examination. He now expressed himself as unable
to make a diagnosis alone, and the lady was referred to
a celebrated gynæcologist in Leipsic. Cauterizations were
now undergone at the professor's house at short intervals, and
further treatment of a similar character was to be carried out
at the patient's own house, which was, however, discontinued
when the patient was referred to me. Examination showed:
metritis following upon sub-involution of the uterus, anteversion
with prolapsus of the whole organ. Both uterine
lips were swollen, and on examination with the speculum a
greenish-yellow discharge was seen to flow from the uterus.
All local treatment was discontinued, the woman received for
the first time in April, 1876, <i>Aur. mur. nat.</i>, and in June,
1876, again became pregnant; the treatment with gold was
continued until the 8th month of pregnancy, in consequence
of which the uterus was found in its normal position on examination
twelve days after her safe confinement on March
30th. The menses, which up to this time had been very
painful, returned for the first time on the 25th of April, and
were quite free from suffering.</p>

<p>But now let us ask, whether we have in the salts of gold a
simile for the diseases of the female sexual organs under the
comprehensive name of chronic metritis. We find in the
hom&#339;opathic proving, inflammatory affections of the internal
organs; fainting depression and emaciation; great anxiety,
sadness, dizziness, whimsical mood, weariness of life, morbid
desires, and headache; nausea, vomiting; pressure in the
gastric region; cardialgia, contractive, drawing pains in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
abdomen. <i>Stitches in the left hypochondrium, pinching and
burning in the right</i>, the abdomen sensitive to touch, with
distension; dull pains in the abdomen; drawing and stinging
in the whole abdomen; eruption of small papules above the
pubes; <i>decreased excretion of urine</i>, pressure on urinating,
burning on urinating; redness, burning, swelling and moisture
of the labia, <i>discharge of yellow mucus</i>, menstruation too soon
and lasts too long; amenorrh&#339;a; labor-like pains, as if the
menses would appear; symptoms which certainly correspond
to the whole picture of chronic metritis and its results.</p>

<p>The mode of administration which I have used for <i>Aur.
mur. nat.</i> is in trituration. Generally I have had the patient
herself divide into three parts a 10 gr. powder of the 3d trit.,
and take one of these dry just one hour after each meal. But
I have also used the 1st and 2d trituration. The effect cannot
be seen before four weeks, hence I seldom make a further
examination before that time. Many women notice a remarkable
increase of the appetite during the use of gold.
After the administration of the 1st trit. I have observed frequent,
dark stools. An increase in the urine with a thick,
gray sediment is often seen. * * *</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Uterine Diseases.</span></p>

<p>Uterine diseases, according to my experience of many
years, make more marriages unfruitful than all the other
known or fancied hindrances to child-bearing. They can
exist many years even with a blooming appearance, without
apparently disturbing the general health, and on that account
are often overlooked and mistaken by physicians themselves,
who are not concerned about gynæcological examinations, or
else make only superficial investigations, not having their
eyes at the ends of their fingers. I beg, therefore, if this
communication should give rise to a more extensive use of
<i>Aur. mur. nat.</i>, above all things, a thorough gynæcological
examination, not leaving this to the so-called surgeons and
midwives. If women complain of gastric troubles, dizziness,
pain in the loins and back, disturbances of urination or defe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>cation,
with a more or less pronounced hysterical appearance,
and withal purposely or unwittingly deceive themselves and
the physician; if, added to these, leucorrh&#339;a and a sensation
as if everything would drop out of the abdominal cavity, one
may say of the patient that her uterus is diseased, and may
base upon that his proposal for an examination, which will
give the correct information of the nature of the malady. As
a rule, every deep-seated, morbid alteration in the uterine
tissues entails suffering upon the nervous system, which, being
in such close relation with the uterus, not seldom apparently
suffers the most.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hysteria.</span></p>

<p>Because the uterus receives its nerves from the sympathetic
system, which governs nutrition, circulation, respiration with
distribution of animal heat, gestation, etc., these functions
being out of sight, it is difficult to get at the root of the matter
as regards the uterus in a suffering woman. Her sensations
and fancies offer, according to her education, organization,
etc., a wide field in which to make her a burden to herself
and others. Her mind is generally out of order, she knows
not why. In the more advanced stages of disease, the functions
of the higher nervous system, the organs of sense, and
even the mental activities are disordered. Then appears that
chameleon of diseases, which goes by the name of <i>hysteria</i>,
suitable in so far as hysteria almost without exception takes
root in the "hystera" or uterus. I shall certainly not deny
the possibility of primary or purely nervous diseases of the
uterus, hysteria sine materia; I am nevertheless convinced
that in at least nine cases out of ten, hysteria depends upon
objective, sensible, perceptible changes in the uterus. It is
these whose existence I ascertain by a thorough examination,
and according to these that I regulate my treatment; they
give me in every case a more certain starting point than a
lengthy account of true and imaginary suffering. If I find,
however, no palpable abnormality in the tissue to remove, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
prescribe <i>Aur. mur. nat.</i> simply as an excellent nervine, following
Niemeyer, it occasionally does good, but generally
leaves me in the lurch.</p>

<h3>AVENA SATIVA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Graminaceæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Oats.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The fresh green plant, gathered in August, is
pounded to a pulp and macerated with two parts by weight of
alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Comparatively little has been written concerning this remedy, the tincture
of oats. It acquired a bad reputation somewhere in the "eighties"
by being advertised as a proprietary remedy making wonderful cures, but
analysis showed the advertised "avena" to contain opium. The following
outline of the drug is by Dr. E. H. Russell, in <i>North American Journal of
Hom&#339;opathy</i>):</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Avena sativa</i> is pre-eminently an anti-neurotic, quieting
the nervous system to a remarkable degree. Its special sphere
of action seems to be upon the male sexual organs, regulating
the functional irregularities of these parts perhaps as
much as any drug can. It is a most useful remedy in all
cases of nervous exhaustion, general debility, nervous palpitation
of the heart, insomnia, inability to keep the mind
fixed upon any one subject, etc., more especially when any
or all of these troubles is apparently due to nocturnal emissions,
masturbation, over sexual intercourse, and the like.
For these disorders it is truly specific. It is one of the most
valuable means for overcoming the bad effects of the morphine
habit. In most cases in which the habitue has not
used more than four grains daily the opiate may be abruptly
discontinued, and even substituted, without any serious results.
If a larger quantity than this amount has been taken
for some time, it is better to gradually reduce the daily dose
of morphine, in the usual manner, simply prescribing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<i>Avena</i> in addition. The latter should be given in the same
dose, as a rule, regardless of the amount of morphine taken.
In other words, it is not necessary to increase the <i>Avena</i> as
the opiate is withdrawn. When the quantity of morphine
has not exceeded four grains daily it should be stopped at
once, as stated above, and <i>Avena</i> given in its stead in fifteen-drop
doses, four times a day, in a wineglassful of hot water.
By this method the disagreeable after-effects will be much
less than though the dose of morphine is gradually reduced,
and the patient will find life quite bearable, as a rule, at the
end of a week.</p>

<p><i>Avena sativa</i> should always be given in appreciable doses
of the tincture. Fifteen drops three or four times a day, well
diluted, will usually meet the case. It may be given in
doses of from five to sixty drops in rare instances. It should,
however, never be given in larger quantities than twenty
minims unless the patient is thoroughly accustomed to the
remedy, and has found the usual dose insufficient. Otherwise
there is danger of getting the physiological effect of the
drug, which is <i>pain at the base of the brain</i>. When this
symptom makes its appearance the medicine should be discontinued
for a day or two, and then given in reduced doses.
There seems to be no danger whatever of forming the habit
of taking this drug, as it can be suddenly abandoned at any
time without evil consequences, even when given in large
quantities. In one case it was prescribed by the writer in
sixty-drop doses, night and morning, <i>for one year</i>, and then
abruptly stopped, nothing being substituted therefore, without
bad effects.</p>

<p>Whenever a quick action is desired, and in all cases where
<i>Avena</i> is given to overcome the morphine habit, it should be
prepared in hot water. It is also a good plan to prescribe it
in this fashion wherever indigestion complicates the case.</p>

<p>The writer has employed this drug in his private practice
for a number of years with the most gratifying results. He
has very rarely found it to fail when indicated, and on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of his high opinion of the remedy he has taken great
pleasure in thus bringing it prominently to the attention of
the medical profession.</p>

<h3>AZADIRACHTA INDICA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The fresh bark is pounded to a pulp and
macerated in two parts by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following synopsis of <i>Azadirachta Ind.</i>, is contributed by P. C.
Majumdar, M. D., of Calcutta, India):</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Azadirachta Indica.</i> Syn.: Sanskrit, Nimba; Bengala and
Hindi, Nim. Belongs to the natural order Meliaeæ. It is a
large tree. Bark is used for making tinctures from which
provings were instituted. The leaves, bark, wood, roots and
fruits, in short, every part of this tree, is intensely bitter.
According to Ayurveda (Hindu System of Medicine) the different
parts of this tree possess different medicinal properties.
Bhava Misra, Charak, Susratha and several other Sanskrit
authors agree that its bark, though very disagreeable in taste,
is generally used with success in cases of lassitude, thirst,
cough, fever, loss of appetite, helmenthiasis, boils, bilious derangements,
catarrh, vomiting, cutaneous diseases, hiccough,
gonorrh&#339;a, etc.; its leaves are used in some forms of ophthalmic
disease, helmenthiasis and disorders brought on by deranged
bile or use of poisonous things. A decoction of fresh
leaves is used as a favorite wash to cure old ulcers of long
standing. It removes within a short time the sloughs and
promotes the healing. The fruit is purgative, demulcent, and
is used in some forms of cutaneous affections. A kind of oil
is produced from the seed of ripe fruits, and this oil is said to
cure lepra, eczema and some other obstinate skin diseases.</p>

<p>Nim is also praised by some of the Allopathic physicians
for its tonic, antiseptic, astringent and anti-periodic properties.
Its febrifuge action is well-known in our country. Kanirages
(native physicians) use Nim as the principal substance in their<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>
febrifuge medicines. The vast range of its action is chiefly
due to azaderine, margocine and katechin, the three active
principles found in this tree. Nim was proved by me and one
of my students, U. C. Bagchi. A full report of the proving
was published in the <i>Indian Hom&#339;opathic Review</i>, Vol. iii,

<h3>BACILLINUM, TUBERCULINUM AND AVIAIRE, THE
VIRUSES OF TUBERCULOSIS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Triturate in the usual way.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The literature on these several preparations is so extensive that we must
confine ourselves to the paper read by Dr. Francois Cartier, Physician to
the Hospital St. Jacques, Paris, at the International Hom&#339;opathic Congress,
1896, it covering the ground more completely than any other. For fuller information
on <i>Bacillinum</i> the reader is referred to Dr. J. Compton Burnett's
book, the <i>New Cure for Consumption</i>.)</p></blockquote>

<p>I must disclaim any intention of traversing afresh the
pathogenesy of <i>Tuberculin</i>, or of instituting an examination
into the various treatises put forth on the subject of the virus<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>
of tuberculosis by the allopathic as well as by the hom&#339;opathic
school.</p>

<p>The materia medica of <i>Tuberculin</i> takes its rise in the
complex result of the use of Koch's lymph, in experiments
upon animals, and in certain symptoms observed by those
who have experimented upon themselves with different products
of tuberculous nature. I shall therefore indicate the
published sources, and I specially desire to place before the
Hom&#339;opathic Congress of London the tuberculous virus
under certain aspects which are perhaps new; and if my conclusions
seem somewhat paradoxical I am content to accept,
with a good grace, the criticisms of my colleagues.</p>

<p>Fourteen years anterior to the researches of Koch, Hering,
Swan and Biegler availed themselves, as a hom&#339;opathic
remedy, of the maceration of tuberculous lungs, and of the
sputa of tuberculous subjects.</p>

<p>Dr. J. Compton Burnett in his book, "A Cure for Consumption,"
several years before Koch's experiments, noticed symptoms
resulting from taking the preparation which he calls
<i>Bacillinum</i>.</p>

<p>Drs. de Keghel<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and J. H. Clarke<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> instituted an inquiry
into the symptoms produced by the employment of Koch's
lymph in the case of tuberculous and non-tuberculous patients.</p>

<p>Dr. Mersch<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> published a pathogenesy, based to a large extent
upon that of Dr. de Keghel; it is an excellent work.</p>

<p>Dr. d'Abzen,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> of Lisbon, sent to the Tuberculosis Congress
of 1895, at Coimbra, a study of the works of Koch and
Pasteur, and an enumeration of the treatises published by
hom&#339;opathists.</p>

<p>We must notice also an English translation of Dr. Mersch's
pathogenesy, by Dr. Arnulphy, of Chicago, in which special
attention is paid to the symptoms observed in healthy and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>non-tuberculous persons, with some original remarks about
<i>Tuberculin</i>. It is published in the <i>Clinique</i> for this year
(February, 1896).</p>

<p>Nor must we overlook a series of writers who have published
isolated observations of the cases of persons cured with
<i>Tuberculin</i>. Such are Drs. Lambreghts, Joussett, Zoppritz,
Horace Holmes, Richardson, Young, Clarke, Pinart, Youman,
U. H. Merson, Snow, Lamb, Clarke, Ebersole, W. James,
Kunkel, A. Zoppritz, Steinhauf, Van den Berghe, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Finally, for my own part, in my articles in <i>L'Art Médical</i>,
published three years ago, and in the <i>Hahnemannian Monthly</i>
(July, 1894), I have insisted on hom&#339;opathic action of the
viruses of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>In certain of the pathogenesies of <i>Tuberculin</i> we find
thrown pell-mell together symptoms appertaining to Koch's
lymph, as well as others which belong to the product baptized
by several names, such as <i>Bacillinum</i> and <i>Tuberculin</i>, in the
recommendation of which Hering and Swan, and Dr. J. Compton
Burnett, in England, have made themselves conspicuous.</p>

<p><i>Bacillinum</i>&mdash;since it must be distinguished from Koch's
<i>Tuberculin</i>&mdash;is a maceration of a typical tuberculous lung.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
Koch's lymph is an extract in glycerine of dead tuberculous
bacilli. The former is compound natural infection; the latter
is a product of laboratory experiment. In the one, various
bacteriological species are associated which give, clinically,
an appearance of cachexia and of hectic fever; from the other
we may sometimes observe vascular, cardiac, renal changes
having no connection with the clinical "syndrome" of pulmonary
tuberculosis. To place these products together in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>same pathogenesy gives an absolutely wrong sense, and the
fact that both contain Koch's bacillus gives no excuse for
confounding them. In my opinion there are, from a hom&#339;opathic
point of view, distinct differences between <i>Bacillinum</i>
and the Koch's lymph.</p>

<p>Experimentally Koch's bacillus, like many other microbes,
does not reproduce a clinical symptom-group; and we hom&#339;opaths
must have an assemblage of clearly-defined symptoms
before prescribing a poison on hom&#339;opathic principles. Such
is unfortunately the case with many other microbes in pure
culture. The experimental diphtheria does not resemble clinical
diphtheria. The pneumococcus, pathogenetic of pneumonia,
is met with in many other diseases, such as pleurisy,
salpingitis, meningitis, etc. Koch's bacillus, too, sometimes
remarkably mild in its effects, and seeming to meet with no
reaction in the system, evolves aside as in the verrucous
tuberculosis; while at other times nothing is able to arrest
the action of this terrible microbe, and the world still waits
in vain for the man who shall find the means of combatting
it. The toxins of tuberculosis are far from reproducing clinical
tuberculosis; yet even here we find a curious aspect sometimes
assumed by certain poisons drawn from the pure cultivation
of microbes. We cannot produce with <i>Tuberculin</i>
symptoms analogous to those of real tuberculosis&mdash;as it is
possible, for instance, to produce tetanus with the toxine alone,
<i>Tetanin</i>.</p>

<p>As a general rule, in the case of a healthy man, Koch's
lymph would not develop any reaction, its effects manifesting
themselves in a febrile congestion, which betrays the presence
of tubercles. In our pathogeneses (those of Mersch-Arnulphy),
we note the following symptoms&mdash;"catarrhal
pneumonia with soft hepatisation, and tendency to abscess
formation; at post-mortems it is not a gelatinous or fibrinous
exudation which oozes out from the alveoli, but an opaque
and watery fluid; 'never,' so says Virchow, 'is there found
the characteristic lesion of croupous pneumonia.'" A pneu<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>monia
from which issues an aqueous and opaque liquid! I
confess I do not understand it.</p>

<p>Experimentally this same lymph of Koch gives symptoms
of inflammation of the arteries which are not found in clinical
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Animals inoculated with progressive doses of <i>Avian tuberculin</i>,
or with serum of tuberculous animals, undergo wasting
and loss of appetite, and other general symptoms. They may
die of cachexia, or may develop an isolated abscess; but they
do not present characteristic symptoms as they would under
the action of <i>Cantharis</i>, of <i>Phosphorus</i>, or of <i>Lead</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, inoculation with dead bacilli may produce real
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>In the pathogenesy put forth by hom&#339;opathists, pulmonary
symptoms do not occupy a prominent place. Dr. Burnett,
who has experimented on himself with <i>Bacillinum</i>, notes at
the end of his symptoms, after the headache, a slight and almost
insignificant cough.</p>

<p>In explaining the clinical forms of infectious complaints,
we are frequently forced to admit the increasingly preponderant
part played by association of microbes&mdash;as it is the
frequent case in diphtheria&mdash;and especially the modifications
which depend directly on the disposition of the organ attacked,
and not upon the action of the microbe itself.</p>

<p>An examination of the above considerations leads me to
the following conclusions:</p>

<p>1. That the importance of the materia medica of the tubercular
virtues ought not to be exaggerated. There are few
characteristic symptoms to take off; it is more wise to guide
oneself in the hom&#339;opathic application of the therapeutics
by the clinical symptoms of the evolution of the various
tuberculosis, rather than by the intoxication produced by
their active products, the <i>Tuberculins</i>.</p>

<p>2. Koch's lymph, <i>Bacillinum</i> and <i>Avian tuberculin</i> must
be studied separately, clinically as well as experimentally.
<i>Bacillinum</i> presents symptoms very different from those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
<i>Avian tuberculin</i>, and especially from those of Koch's lymph;
and I intend to divide my remarks into three parts, corresponding
to these three substances, which have actually become
hom&#339;opathic remedies.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At the time of the introduction of the ever-memorable
Koch's lymph, there were included under the head of poisonings
by this drug vascular lesions, as I have mentioned above,
acute arteritis, arterio-sclerosis, changes in the vessels of the
heart and the kidneys, and acute nephritis. Apropos of
acute nephritis, the supposition was that the kidney became
congested because of the presence in that part of certain
tubercular islets, and that the kidney responded, like the
tuberculous lung, under the influence of the <i>Tuberculin</i>, by
acute congestion.</p>

<p>However this might be, these vascular lesions drew attention
to the hom&#339;opathicity of Koch's lymph in nephritis.
Dr. Jousset has experimented in it with encouraging results,
using hom&#339;opathic dilutions, in Bright's disease; and at the
meeting of the Société Hom&#339;opathique Francaise on April
18, 1895, Drs. Tessier, Silva and Jousset, father and son,
mentioned the diminution of albumen in cases of chronic
and incurable nephritis, and the appearance of that substance
in acute cases.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnulphy, in a series of articles in the Chicago
<i>Clinique</i>, which I have read attentively, speaks favorably of
Koch's lymph in hom&#339;opathic dilutions in cases of tuberculosis.
Personally I have not used it, and I am loth to pass
judgment on observations recorded in every good faith. I
would merely remark to my honorable colleague that Koch's
lymph was used in our school in all the hom&#339;opathic dilutions
possible at the moment of its far-resounding discovery&mdash;a
fact which he should know as well as myself. To mention
only one instance&mdash;Drs. Simon, V. L. Simon Boyer and
Chancerel used the drug at the Hahnemann Hospital in Paris
at the time of the arrival in France of the first consignment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of lymph from Germany; and I am nearly certain that there
is not at this time a single country where hom&#339;opathists
have not used this remedy in all the infinitesimal dilutions.
Hom&#339;opaths and allopaths have actually taken pretty much
the same side as regards the primitive formula put forward
by Koch (I am not now speaking of trials of new tuberculins);
and Dr. Arnulphy would be fortunate enough were
he able to revive its credit after its several years' oblivion as
a cure of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Clinically this lymph of Koch has led to wonderful cures
in lobular pneumonia, for it produces pneumonia, broncho
pneumonia, and congestion of the lungs in the tuberculous
patient. Its hom&#339;opathic action would thus appear more
trustworthy than its isopathic, and Dr. Arnulphy makes this
remark: "I make bold to state that no single remedy in our
materia medica, not excepting <i>Ipecac</i>, <i>Iodine</i>, <i>Tartar emetic</i>,
and even <i>Phosphorus</i>, approaches the singular efficacy of
<i>Tuberculin</i> in well-authenticated cases of that affection
(broncho pneumonia, be it) in the child, the adult, or the
aged. Its rapidity of action in some cases is little short of
wonderful, and all who have used it in this line are unanimous
in their unbounded praise of its working."</p>

<p>The four cases quoted by Dr. Mersch (<i>Journal Belge d'
Homéopathie</i>, November, 1894, January and May, 1895) are
very instructive:</p>

<p>The first is that of a member of the Dutch Parliament who
had contracted a pneumonia which reached a chronic stage.
While undergoing a relapse his expectoration assumed a
rusty-red color, which color disappeared completely in three
days on treatment with <i>Tuberculin</i> 30th.</p>

<p>The second case is that of a person who was seized, after
an attack of measles, with broncho-pneumonia. On the fifth
day Dr. Mersch prescribed <i>Tuberculin</i> 6th. In a day or two
the condition of the chest was completely altered.</p>

<p>In the third case an old lady was likewise attacked with
broncho-pneumonia, together with digestive troubles, and was<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>
for a long time in a serious state. After the lapse of a single
night, which was a rather distressing one, under the action of
the remedy the amelioration was great, and it was with difficulty
that Dr. Mersch found a touch of bronchitis in the very
place where the day before he had heard nothing but the
tubular <i>souffle</i>. The prescription ran: <i>Tuberculin</i> 6th, eight
packets of ten globules each, one to be taken every two
hours.</p>

<p>Finally, in a fourth case, the patient was a lady of vigorous
physique, and twenty-five years of age, who had capillary
bronchitis, combined with the symptoms of angina pectoris.
Dr. Mersch had once more had an opportunity of viewing
with astonishment the rapidity with which the therapeutic
action of <i>Tuberculin</i> may be manifested in such cases.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><i>Bacillinum</i> deserves study from two points of view, isopathically
in the treatment of tuberculosis, hom&#339;opathically in
the treatment of affections of the respiratory organs without
tuberculosis. To fully understand its action it is necessary
to know with exactness its composition. Dr. J. Compton Burnett
has christened it <i>Bacillinum</i>, because he recognized in
its lower dilutions the presence of Koch's bacilli. As a matter
of fact, <i>Bacillinum</i> contains in its elements everything
that a cavity of a tuberculous lung is capable of containing;
that is to say, many other things besides Koch's bacillus.
The bacillus of Koch is feebly pyogenetic, and the purulent
contents of the cavities include pyogenetic staphylococci
and streptococci, to say nothing of the organic products
which play a large part in the production of the hectic fever
of tuberculosis. It is a combination of toxins, then, which
constitutes <i>Bacillinum</i>, and especially of toxins of a purulent
nature. I lay stress upon this last fact, as it goes to sustain
the opinion that I hold on the action of <i>Bacillinum</i>.</p>

<p>The infinitesimal dose of Hom&#339;opathy is in no way inimical
to the entrance of all the elements constituting a substance
into its materia medica. The salts of potassium owe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
their effect to their base as well as to their acid; <i>Graphites</i>
is analogous to <i>Carbo</i> and <i>Ferrum</i>, because it contains both
carbon and iron; <i>Hepar sulphuris calcareum</i> acts by reason of
its sulphur as well as of its lime. <i>Bacillinum</i>, then, combines
in its action all its constituent products, owing its
efficacy to its suppurative microbes as well as its inclusion
of Koch's bacillus.</p>

<p>This method of viewing the matter, which is peculiar to
myself, permits me to include in one and the same category
the action of <i>Bacillinum</i> in consumption and its action in
non-tuberculous bronchitis.</p>

<p>I have studied conscientiously the action of <i>Bacillinum</i> in
tuberculosis, and I must confess that I am looking out still
for an authentic case of cure by this remedy. Nevertheless,
in the midst of the paucity of drugs for the treatment of
tuberculosis, I am happy to state that <i>Bacillinum</i> has produced
in my hands considerable amelioration of the symptoms
of this disease. Perhaps in certain cases it produces
what Bernheim would call "la treve tuberculeuse." But
sooner or later the drug, after ameliorating the symptoms,
loses its effect, and the disease again gets the upper hand. I
wish I could be as optimistic as Dr. J. Compton Burnett in
his interesting book, "A New Cure for Consumption;" but
that is impossible.</p>

<p>In looking over my observations I find that the symptom
which has always undergone the greatest mitigation has been
the <i>expectoration</i>. When <i>Bacillinum</i> acts on tuberculosis the
sputum is less abundant, less purulent, less green, and more
a&#275;rated. It is this which has always struck me most in
the action of <i>Bacillinum</i>. It is rarely that a patient satisfied
with the remedy fails to remark, "I expectorate less." In
cases of dry cough at the beginning of tuberculosis I have
noticed that the drug evidently arrests the tubercular process.</p>

<p>I would most severely criticise, as well for myself as for
others, cases of so-called "cure of tuberculosis." There certainly
are persons in whom the disease does not develop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
These may have been accidentally infected, and their phagocytes
may have struggled against their microbe foe. But in
the case of an individual in whom the tubercle finds a suitable
field for development, it is the merest chance that he entirely
recovers without ulterior relapse; mostly it is a seeming
cure, caused by a time of pause in the microbian pullulation.</p>

<p>Last year I had under my care, at the Hospital St. Jacques,
a truly extraordinary case. It has been followed out by Dr.
Jousset, by Dr. Cesar, head of the hospital laboratory, and by
the house-physicians. It was that of a woman who entered
the hospital suffering from influenza, and who, a few days
after a slight amelioration of her symptoms, was attacked
with a pulmonary congestion, clearly localized in the top of
the left lung, and accompanied by all the clinical symptoms
of tuberculosis&mdash;râles and moist crepitation, dulness, exaggeration
of the thoracic vibration, nummular expectoration,
fever, perspiration, spitting of blood&mdash;everything was there.
Examination of the sputa showed distinctly the presence of
Koch's bacilli. Everyone at the hospital diagnosed tuberculosis,
myself the first. I gave her <i>Avian tuberculin</i> and in
three weeks all the symptoms had disappeared. That woman
left the hospital completely cured, and <i>a year afterwards</i> her
health was still perfect. In my opinion this patient never
had consumption; she was attacked with pseudo-phymic
bronchitis, a complication which is very often found with influenza,
and which may very easily be mistaken for tuberculosis;
and in spite of the presence in the sputa of Koch's
bacillus I would not register it as a case of tuberculosis, because,
in contradistinction to that single case, I could mention
twenty cases of tuberculosis whose symptoms neither
<i>Avian tuberculin</i> nor any other such drug has cured.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no connection between the clinical
evolution of real tuberculosis and observations based on the
autopsies of old persons whose lungs contain cavities, but
whose death was not due to tuberculosis. To admit, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Professor Brouardel, that three-fourths of those who have
died a violent death are possessed of tuberculous lesions,
whose existence was not suspected while the subject was living,
would be running absolutely counter to clinical experience.
The time is probably at hand when the different kinds
of tuberculosis will be distinguished and separated, as we distinguish
and separate the varieties of serious pleurisy and
purulent pleurisy, of broncho-pneumonia arising from the
presence of pneumococci, of streptococci, or of staphylococci.
Malassez has already described cases of pseudo-tuberculosis,
or zoogleic-tuberculosis, whose existence has only been acknowledged
of late years. Courmont has discovered a pseudo-bacillosis
of a bovine origin. We have a pseudo-bacillosis
of a strepto bacillar origin, not to mention the "professional"
tuberculoses, such as that to which persons are exposed who
have to breathe the fumes of charcoal.</p>

<p>To return to <i>Bacillinum</i>, I consider this remedy as a powerful
moderator of the muco-purulent secretion of consumption.
While diminishing the secretion it modifies the auscultation;
there is less thick sputum, the cavities are drier, the peri-tuberculosis
congestion less intense. The clinical symptoms
follow those of the auscultation; as the patient expectorates
less he is less feeble, coughs less, gains strength, and regains
his spirits; but the tubercle remains untouched. The peri-tuberculous
congestion only is diminished, as one may observe
with the naked eye when Koch's lymph is employed
in the amelioration of lupus. The peri-tuberculous inflammation
disappears; the skin seems healthy, but the yellow
tubercle remains as it was, and the patient is still uncured.
Such are the limits I assign to <i>Bacillinum</i> in its action on
consumption.</p>

<p>Far more potent is the part played by <i>Bacillinum</i> in non-tuberculous
pulmonary affections, for the simple reason that
the struggle is with a less redoubtable opponent. Ebersole,
Young, Zoppritz, Burnett, James, Holmes, Jousset, Steinhauf
have published cases of the cure of acute bronchitis, influenza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
diarrh&#339;a, syphilitic eruptions, cystitis, ringworm of the scalp,
nephritis, idiocy, retarded dentition, cretinism, gout, rheumatism,
etc., with <i>Tuberculin</i> or <i>Bacillinum</i>.</p>

<p>If we wish to prescribe <i>Bacillinum</i> successfully in non-tuberculous
affections, we must observe, on auscultation, symptoms
analogous to those which are perceptible in tuberculosis.
The peculiar characteristics which indicate <i>Bacillinum</i> for
non-tuberculous maladies of the respiratory organs are, in my
opinion, the two following: The first is <i>oppression</i>; the second,
<i>muco purulent</i> expectoration. These two phenomena show
themselves always in the last stage of tuberculosis; that is to
say, together with the products contained in the preparation
of <i>Bacillinum</i>. <i>Dyspn&#339;a resulting from bronchial and pulmonary
obstruction caused by a super-abundant secretion from the
mucous membrane is marvellously relieved by Bacillinum.</i> I
put forward this fact, not on the evidence of a single isolated
observation, but on that of several cases conscientiously
studied. Such expectoration leads to the auscultation of sub-crepitant
râles, sounding liquid and gurgling, having some
analogy to the moist sounds of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>This power of <i>Bacillinum</i> to relieve oppression in pulmonary
catarrh is in no way surprising from the point of view
of the law of similars; for in the acute and infectious stage
of tuberculosis the dyspn&#339;a is a characteristic symptom, and
is far more distressing than the cough. I have read with
pleasure in the work of Dr. Mersch, of Brussels, on <i>Tuberculin</i>,
of a fact which corroborates my statement as to the influence
of <i>Bacillinum</i> over catarrhal dyspn&#339;a. After the sixth dose
the patient, who was suffering from bronchial asthma, was
seized with violent intercostal pains, with augmented cough;
but the oppression entirely disappeared after the first day, and
did not return even three months after the treatment had
ceased.</p>

<p>In <i>L' Art Médical</i> of January, 1894, and in the <i>Hahnemannian
Monthly</i> of July, 1894, I published the case of an
old man of eighty years of age, suffering from broncho-pneu<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>monia,
who, in the last stage of asphyxia, had been saved by
<i>Bacillinum</i>. Two years ago I was called upon to treat another
octogenarian who, as the result of a cold, developed an obstruction
in the bronchial tubes, and at the basis of the lungs.
He passed sleepless nights in a sitting posture, striving to
draw deep inspirations. <i>Phosphorus</i>, <i>Arsenic</i>, and <i>Stibium</i>
produced no relief. I gave him <i>Bacillinum</i> 30th, and he slept
the whole night through. Doses of this remedy, administered
<i>at longish intervals</i>, always produced a remarkable amelioration.
Last year I was called to the house of an upholsterer.
He preferred not going to bed at all to passing the night in
bed without closing his eyes. He had humid asthma with
incessant cough, which ended by causing him to eject thick
yellow and puriform mucus. For eight days he took <i>Arsenic</i>
and <i>Blatta</i>, and for a whole week he passed the nights without
sleeping. From the day he took <i>Bacillinum</i> he was able
to sleep. I saw him again this year in good health. Once or
twice he was attacked with the same bronchorrhea, and had
my prescription made up at the chemists, with the same success.
This year, too, I have given <i>Bacillinum</i> to several
patients at the Hôpital St. Jacques for the same symptoms,
and it has never yet failed me.</p>

<p>When I am called upon to treat a patient suffering from an
obstruction of the bronchial tubes occasioned by mucus, which
is frequently thick and opaque and puriform&mdash;an obstruction
extending to the delicate bronchial ramification, and causing
oppression more frequently than cough, I turn my thoughts
at once to <i>Bacillinum</i>. <i>Bacillinum</i> is a drug for old people,
or, at any rate, for those whose lungs are old; for those
chronically catarrhal, or whose pulmonary circulation is enfeebled
without regard to the age of the subject; for those
who have dyspn&#339;a, and who cough with difficulty from inaction
of the respiratory ducts; for the humid asthmatic, the
bronchorrheal, who feel suffocated at night; and, finally, for
those who, after taking cold, are straightway attacked with<span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>
pulmonary congestion. Here, I believe, is the exact sphere of
action of <i>Bacillinum</i> as a hom&#339;opathic remedy.</p>

<p><i>Bacillinum</i> has been stigmatized as an unstable product. I
consider this reproach ill-founded. <i>Bacillinum</i> is no more unstable
than <i>Psorinum</i>, which is an approved remedy in Hom&#339;opathy.
Typical tuberculous lungs contain practically
almost invariable elements. Do not the microbes produced
by cultivation and the animal extracts show any variation in
quality, and do they not change in the long run?</p>

<p>Like most hom&#339;opathists who have made use of <i>Bacillinum</i>,
I think it is best given in the high dilutions and at long
intervals. Dr. J. Compton Burnett and Van der Berghe recommended
the higher potencies&mdash;the 1000th, 100,000, etc.,
whereas I content myself with the 30th, which satisfies every
requirement. As regards the intervals which must elapse between
the doses, certain writers recommend from one to two
weeks. In acute cases I generally give six globules of <i>Bacillinum</i>
30th every two or three days; and in chronic cases of
tuberculosis, etc., one dose about twice a week.</p>

<p>We are no longer permitted to include in the same description
the tuberculosis of birds and that of mammals. Although
the two bacilli, as far as form and color are concerned, are
absolutely identical, the evolution of the two forms of tuberculosis
presents characteristics so different that we are forced
to study them separately. At this day the debate is a question
of words, and experts discuss whether there are two distinct
genera or merely two different species.</p>

<p>It is this characteristic of non-transmissibility from mammals
to birds, and <i>vice versa</i>, which forms the chief difference
between the two kinds of tuberculosis. Strauss failed in his
endeavor to inoculate a fowl with tuberculosis by injecting
fifty kilogrammes of tuberculous human sputa, whereas the
fowl, absolutely impervious to human tuberculosis, became
infected when treated with a very slight quantity of the avian
tuberculosis. The guinea-pig, so sensitive to the human
microbe, presented encysted abscesses when treated with the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>
virus of birds; it dies of cachexia, but never, as far as the
naked eye can discern, of generalized tuberculosis. Rabbits
are more sensitive to the avian infection. Dogs are absolutely
refractory. The monkey, so delicate in our climate, and
which almost invariably perishes from tuberculosis, is uninjured
by inoculation from avian virus. The parrot is a remarkable
exception to the general rule; it is the only bird
which resists avian tuberculosis, while, on the other hand, it
is sensitive to that of man. Such facts as these irrefutably
differentiate the two kinds of tuberculosis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p><p>Ever since this variety of tuberculosis has been distinguished,
attempts have been made to inoculate or cure human
tuberculosis with that of birds. In our school the thing has
been attempted at the Hôpital St. Jacques, where <i>Aviaire</i> has
been administered in hom&#339;opathic dilutions, in potions or
through punctures in cases of consumption. As a matter of
fact, neither allopaths nor hom&#339;opaths have succeeded in obtaining
a formula which will cure consumption with the
virus of birds. Amelioration has been noted as with other
remedies, but never a series of authenticated cures. Nevertheless,
in every country experiments are continually being
made; we must hope that they will end in a more decisive
success than is at present the case.</p>

<p>Hoping to profit by the hom&#339;opathicity of an active virus,
I was, I think, one of the first who employed <i>Aviaire</i> in non-tuberculous
respiratory affections on the lines of <i>Bacillinum</i>,
and I am bound to say that up to the present my faith in the
law of similars has not been shaken by my experiments.</p>

<p>In <i>L'Art Médical</i> (August, 1895) I published a number of
cases in which I successfully treated localized bronchitis, generally
the result of influenza, and reproducing the symptoms
of tuberculosis, with <i>Aviaire</i>. The most characteristic of all
these observations is that of which I have spoken above. The
patient was restored to health as if by magic with <i>Aviaire</i>
within three weeks. Dr. P. Jousset, anticipating my observations,
thus expressed himself in the number of <i>L'Art Médical</i>
preceding the one which contained my remarks: "A young
woman entered the Hôpital St. Jacques at the end of January,
1895, with feverish influenzal bronchitis. At first the patient
was treated with small doses of <i>Sulphate of Quinine</i>, and a
little later she took <i>Ipecac</i> and <i>Bryonia</i> alternately. The
fever disappeared and the general condition improved considerably,
and the sub-crepitant râles became confined to the top
of the left lung. The patient continued to expectorate thick<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>
nummular and puriform sputa, as in the influenza. After
some days the disease resumed its sway, the bodily forces diminished,
the emaciation made great progress, and local and
general signs indicated rapid consumption. Bacteriological
analysis led to the detection of numerous Koch's bacilli. I
gave over the case at this time, and some weeks afterwards I
learnt with surprise that the patient was well and growing
fat, and that the inoculation of the sputa had produced no
effects. The cure has been maintained for three months, and
the young woman has resumed her employment." I had prescribed
<i>Aviaire</i> 100th, five drops a day, during the whole
period of the disease, unaccompanied by any other remedy.</p>

<p>As I have said before, more than a year afterwards the
young woman continued in good health.</p>

<p>Following this case, Dr. Jousset quoted two analogous instances
in his practice, both of influential bronchitis, in which
the sputa contained, for a certain period, Koch's bacillus.
One was cured with <i>Aviaire</i> 6th and strong doses of <i>Sulphate
of Quinine</i>, and the other with <i>Aviaire</i> 6th and twenty drops
of <i>Tincture of Drosera</i>, a day.</p>

<p>"What conclusions must I draw from these facts?" says
Dr. Jousset. "That the avian tuberculosis cured the consumption?
I have failed too often in the treatment of ordinary
consumption with this remedy to admit that." That is
my opinion also.</p>

<p>Koch's bacillus has been found in the nasal secretions of
healthy hospital nurses, and of students of medicine, as noted
by Strauss. Would it not be possible to come across it accidentally
in certain kinds of expectoration, just as the pneumococcus
is found in saliva?</p>

<p>In one of the numbers of <i>La Médecine Moderne</i> of last year
there appeared a short article on the "Influenzas known as
pseudo-phymic." The writer remarked on the strong analogy
which certain complications of pulmonary influenza presented
to acute tuberculosis. He observed, among other forms:
1st, the influenzal bronchitis which affected one of the sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>mits
of the lung, the most difficult form to diagnose from
tuberculosis; 2d, the broncho-pneumonic form; 3d, the
pleuro-pneumonic form, bearing a close resemblance to
tuberculous pleurisy. I might remark that this last form is
still little known and ill-defined. The influenza microbe
always imitates to a remarkable degree the microbe of
tuberculosis in certain instances; and if we wish to effect a
cure on the laws laid down by Hahnemann in certain forms
of influenzal bronchitis, we must frequently seek for the
simillimum in the virus of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>I have mentioned oppression as one of the characteristics of
<i>Bacillinum</i>. Now influenzal bronchitis is markedly accompanied
by an incessant cough and by grave general symptoms.
There is more frequently acute than passive, obstructive and
dyspn&#339;ic congestion. I am inclined to prefer <i>Aviaire</i> to
<i>Bacillinum</i> in such cases, and I should like to briefly touch
upon certain cases in my practice.</p>

<p>I have under my care a little girl of twelve years of age who
has for two years developed an influenza which rapidly leads to
pulmonary symptoms, always distinctly localized in the top of
the left lung. The mother is tuberculous, and the child, who
was born with forceps, has her left chest less developed than
her right. The congestion which accompanies the influenza
is sudden and severe; within twenty-four hours the lung is
invaded, and fine râles are soon heard. Twice running, at
intervals of a year, <i>Aviaire</i> 100th has stifled the symptoms in
a few days. I have seen an analogous case, only with congestion
of the base of the lung.</p>

<p>In my clinical report of the Hôpital St. Jacques (in August,
1895) I note ten cases of acute influenzal bronchitis with incessant
cough, fever, and expectoration, rapidly cured with
<i>Aviaire</i>. This year I have prescribed it with the same success
as at the Hôpital St. Jacques in cases of influenzal bronchitis,
with active congestion. I will mention two cases of
the pulmonary complications of measles which were rapidly
dissipated by this remedy; but I must also mention a third<span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span>
case of measles in which <i>Aviaire</i> failed and <i>Bryonia</i> proved
successful. The child had an acute rubeolic laryngitis, and
few pulmonary symptoms. <i>Bryonia</i> was in this case more
decidedly indicated than <i>Aviaire</i>.</p>

<p>The dilution of <i>Aviaire</i> which I have always used is the
100th. I give usually five drops a day.</p>

<p>It seems that <i>Aviaire</i> does not act in diminishing the cough
like an anodyne or a narcotic, but braces up the whole organism.
The relief of debility and the return of appetite are the
phenomena which I have observed in conjunction with
the diminution of the cough.</p>

<p>I have given <i>Aviaire</i> 100th for weeks, and even for a
month, regularly every day, without having observed excitement
or aggravation. It would thus appear to be a remedy
of long-lasting action, capable in certain cases of modifying
the organism, and of bracing a constitution which has become
enfeebled from the effects of influenza or of suspicious
bronchitis.</p>

<p>In contrast with <i>Bacillinum</i> I have noted, in my observations
on <i>Aviaire</i>, considerable cough and little dyspn&#339;a&mdash;an
acute inflammatory, extremely irritating cough, such as one
meets with in acute diseases or sub-acute affections in young
people; a cough which fatigues, and which leads to enfeeblement
and loss of appetite&mdash;in a word, a suspicious cough. To
conclude my remarks, the utility of <i>Aviaire</i> in <i>suspicious
bronchitis</i>&mdash;an expression on which I again lay stress&mdash;I will
recall certain indubitable examples of the cure (at the
Hôpital St. Jacques) of bronchitis or of pulmonary congestion
at the top of one of the lungs, or of bronchitis on one side
only, or of congestion predominating on one side. These
localizations on one side are sufficiently grave symptoms to
warrant apprehension of the hatching of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>If I were myself attacked, as the result of influenza or
measles, or of some weakening malady, with an incessant
tickling and stubborn cough, with certain closely localized
pulmonary symptoms; if I lost my strength and appetite; if,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in a word, I were attacked by bronchitis whose upshot was
highly doubtful, and which caused apprehension of tuberculosis,
I should not hesitate a single moment, with the examples
which I have had before me, to try <i>Aviaire</i> 100th upon
myself.</p>

<p>Such is the conclusion of my clinical observations made at
Hôpital St. Jacques in August, 1895.</p>

<p>What I said last year I can only repeat with renewed confidence
in this; and I hope that the years which follow will
not cause me to alter my opinion.</p>

<h3>BELLIS PERENNIS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Compositæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Common Names</span>, English Daisy. Garden Daisy. Hens and
Chickens.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The fresh plant, in flower, is pounded to a
pulp and submitted to pressure. The expressed juice is then
mixed with an equal part by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following is from Thomas' <i>Additions to the Hom&#339;opathic Materia
Medica</i>, 1858. To it we may add Dr. J. C. Burnett's statement that <i>Bellis</i> is
a remedy for all ills that may be traced to a sudden wetting when overheated.)</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Bellis perennis</i> or daisy, formerly called <i>consolida</i>, on account
of its vulnerary properties; the roots and leaves were
used in wound drinks, and were considered efficacious in
removing extravasated blood from bruises, etc. It is said to
be refused by cattle on account of its peculiar taste. Lightfoot,
in his <i>Flora Scotica</i>, says: "In a scarcity of garden-stuff,
they (daisies) have, in some countries, been substituted as pot
herbs." My first trial with this plant as a curative agent
was in the autumn of 1856. While on a visit in the neighborhood
of Bangor, a countryman, understanding that I was a
"doctor," wished me to prescribe for his foot, which he had
sprained very badly. Not having either <i>Arnica</i> or <i>Rhus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
with me, I determined to try the effects of the daisy; so
directed him to procure a handful of the leaves and flowers of
the plant, chop them up small, boil them for a quarter of an
hour in half a pint of water, and apply them in linen as a
poultice round the ankle at night. The application was not
made until the next morning, but in half an hour's time the
ankle admitted of very fair motion. A piece of calico wetted
and wrung out of the daisy water was then wrapped round
the ankle, and the man put his shoe on and limped about all
day, walking not less than five miles. He repeated the poultice
at night, and found his ankle so much restored in the
morning that he was able to walk four miles to his work
without experiencing any difficulty. The success, in this
instance, so far exceeded the previous use of <i>Arnica</i> and
<i>Rhus</i>, especially in the time gained, that I had a tincture
from the whole plant made for such uses, and have used it in
sprained ankle from a fall&mdash;the ankle was well the second
day. A sprain of the wrist, which had been a week ailing,
yielded to the daisy in three days. I have also successfully
used it in several severe whitlows; in every case the pure
tincture was used externally. The only provings I have
made with this remedy have been with the pure tincture in
ten or twenty drop doses at a time. After taking the medicine
for fourteen days without any symptoms, I suspended
the use of it&mdash;in two weeks after leaving it off, for the first
time in my life I had a large boil on the back of my neck
(right side), commencing with a dull aching pain; some
difficulty and a bruised pain in keeping the head erect;
slight nausea, want of appetite, and a little giddiness in the
head at times. Pain in middle finger of the left hand, as of
a gathering, for a short time only; and at the same time pain
in inner side of left forearm, as of a boil developing; two
nights before similar pains in corresponding parts of the
right arm&mdash;query, are these effects of <i>Bellis</i> (this was written
December 11, 1856). The boil on the neck came December
7, 1856; began as a slight pimple with burning pain in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
skin, increasing until in six days' time it was very large, of a
dark fiery purple color, and very sore burning and aching
pain in it, accompanied with headache, extending from occiput
to sinciput, of a cold aching character; brain as though
contracted in frontal region, dizziness, etc. (as before stated).
I now set to work to cure myself, which by use of hot fomentations
and lint dipped in &#952; tincture of <i>Belladonna</i> externally,
taking at the same time 3d dil. <i>Belladonna</i> internally, was
soon accomplished. Three days after this was cured, another
made its appearance, which speedily succumbed to the same
remedies. As I had never previously had a boil, and had not
made any change in my diet, I suspected <i>Bellis</i> tincture to be
the cause of the trouble. On the 12th of January, 1857, feeling
my left foot somewhat strained after running, I applied
<i>Bellis</i> &#952; to the strain, which for several days aggravated the
feeling; and in five hours after the application I had another
small boil (three weeks after disappearance of the last), which
yielded to same treatment as the others, by January 19, 1857.
On March 7, 1857, I chewed some daisy flowers. On the
11th, a small boil appeared at the angle of the inferior
maxilla, right side; <i>Belladonna</i> &#952;, externally, cured it. The
last trial I made with the third centesimal dilution of <i>Bellis</i>,
taking three drops on Tuesday, 2d March, 1858, on the following
Friday a small pimple appeared a little behind the
angle of <i>left</i> inferior maxilla; it increased very much in size
and pain by Saturday, when I treated it with <i>Belladonna</i> &#952;
externally, to which it soon yielded. As at no other time in
my life have I suffered from boils, I am inclined to think
these are due to the use of the daisy.</p>

<blockquote><p>(This unintentional proving was published in August, 1896, under the
signature J. d. W. C. The paper referred to by J. d. W. C. was a clipping
from the <i>Eclectic Medical Journal</i>.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i> for March, 1896, p. 133,
there appears an interesting article on the virtues of the plant
named above&mdash;it starts out with: "From the fact that it will
make a 'new' man of an old one in a short time it is an excellent
remedy."</p>

<p>As I am now over sixty years old, it seemed high time to
cast about for something possessing the virtue specified, viz.,
making "a 'new' man out of an old one"&mdash;and to my knowledge,
as I have never had five days' illness confining me to
bed, or even to my room, during the said sixty years, I considered
myself an easy subject for the contemplated rejuvenation;
besides all this, I am what some would call a hom&#339;opathic
"crank;" and believed, and yet believe, if there be
anything that can effect such a transformation it is to be
found only within the lines of Hom&#339;opathy, I immediately
ordered quantum suf. of the article in question from the celebrated
firm of Boericke &amp; Tafel, and started out on the trip
to the "Fountain of Youth" in full confidence that <i>something</i>
would come of it.</p>

<p>The first day I took two doses mother tincture 10-15 drops
each; no special effect noticed&mdash;no youthfulness either!
Second day, ditto; third day, one dose in morning; after bank
hours went to friend's sanctum and engaged in a game of
chess, and while so engaged felt a growing sense of nausea
and thick-headedness&mdash;so much so, that I was obliged to excuse
myself and hurry to my own quarters. <i>Berberis</i>, however,
did not once occur to me&mdash;I had scarce reached my
room when the sense of nausea (seven minutes' lively walk,
since it became really oppressive) had <i>full sway</i>, and having
eaten nothing whatever since the previous evening (as I do
not eat unless I am hungry) the straining was rather severe,
but exactly similar to some previous attacks of "biliousness"&mdash;in
feeling, and color and taste of discharges&mdash;and still
<i>Berberis</i> did not occur to me; as soon as the strain was over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
I was seized with a remarkable and peculiar headache; a
thing of which I have no recollection whatever to have previously
experienced in any shape&mdash;the sensation was that of a
strong, well-defined, compressive band of iron (or some unyielding
substance), about two inches wide, passing <i>entirely
round the head, just above the ears</i>&mdash;it kept on growing
tighter and tighter; I jumped from the reclined position on a
couch, wet a folded towel in cold water, and passed it round
my head so as to cover the "band;" but it gave little relief;
about 10 o'clock I began to think over what I might have
eaten to disagree with me so, and at last <i>Berberis</i> came plump
into sight; I at once prepared a cup of strong, strong coffee
(Hahnemann's antidote, and for which I had to send to a
neighbor), believing it would antidote the <i>Berberis</i> (or rather
hoping it might), and about 12 o'clock there was a slight
diminution of pressure; then more coffee, black and strong,
two or three mouthfuls, and again laid down; by morning the
serious phase of the headache had disappeared, but I was exceedingly
tremulous in nerves and unsteady in gait up to noon,
when I ventured on some oatmeal and syrup&mdash;habitually, I
do not eat meat, or drink tea or coffee, nor spirituous liquors,
nor use tobacco, and have not for over thirty years.</p>

<p>Finally, I "made a good recovery," and now whenever I
have a sensation of biliousness I touch my tongue to my
finger after touching the cork of the mother tincture bottle of
<i>Berberis aqui.</i>; with laid finger&mdash;and have no trouble compared
to what I have usually had&mdash;I believe I may say, I am
subject to bilousness by heredity, but it has removed much
thereof, and this remedy, I think, is good enough for the remainder.</p>

originally published in the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i> in the years 1890 and
1891. A number of papers from American physicians could be added confirming
what Dr. Ray says of the drug.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>Blatta orientalis</i> is a common insect in India, where it
is found abundantly in the dwelling houses. It has rather a
flat body, from an inch to a couple of inches in length; deep
brown color. It can fly a short distance. The wings reach
beyond the body and cover it completely; the feet have several
segments and are provided with prickles.</p>

under class IX of American Hom&#339;opathic Pharmacop&#339;ia, a
tincture can be prepared as under class IV of the same
Pharmacop&#339;ia.</p>

<p>This new unknown remedy has a curious anecdote connected
with it. I call it new because it has not been mentioned
in any of our medical works, although the use of <i>Blatta
Americana</i> (American cockroach) as a remedy for dropsy has
been mentioned in journals. The Indian cockroach is used
not in cases of dropsy but in cases of <i>Asthma</i>, a most obstinate
disease to deal with. In asthma it acts almost specifically.
Before I further proceed to give an account of this new, invaluable
drug I shall narrate here a short story how it came
into use.</p>

<p>Some years ago an elderly gentleman had long been suffering
from asthma; for over twenty years. He took all measures
and tried different methods of both recognized and unrecognized
medical treatments, but unfortunately all proved in<span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>
vain. At last he gave up all treatment and was getting fits
daily. He was brought to such a deplorable condition that
he was left to suffer. He was in the habit of taking tea.
One afternoon as usual he drank his cup of tea&mdash;afterwards he
noticed that his oppression in the chest was much less and
that he was feeling unusually better, so much so that he felt
himself a different being. This led him and his friends to
inquire into the cause of it. He immediately inferred that
the relief was due to the drinking of the <i>tea</i>, although he habitually
drank the same tea but never before had experienced
any such changes. So this change he attributed to something
in the tea. The servant who prepared the tea was sent for and
questioned. His reply was that he made the tea as usual and
there was nothing new in it. The residue of the teacup was
carefully examined, nothing was found there, but on examining
the tea-pot a dead cockroach was discovered. So it was
concluded that this <i>infusion</i> of cockroach did the gentleman
a world of good. The very day he drank that <i>cup of tea</i> he
had hardly any fit of asthma at night, and in a few days he got
entirely well to his and his friends' surprise.</p>

<p>The accounts of his Providential recovery were communicated
to some of his friends&mdash;one of them, not a medical
man, but quite an enterprising gentleman, took this into his
head and resolved to try whether cockroach does any good
to other asthmatic patients. For this purpose he got a lot of
cockroaches, put them alive into a quantity of boiling water
and mixed it after filtering the water when cool with almost
the same quantity of the rectified spirit of wine, so that it
might last for some time without getting soured. This new
mixture (or tincture) he began to try in each and every
case of asthma that he came across. The dose was a drop
each time, 3 or 4 doses daily, and more frequently during the
fits of asthma. Within a short time he made some such
wonderful cures that people began to flock from different
parts of the country to his door. Soon the number of attendants
was so great that he had to manufacture the medicine<span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>
by pounds and all this medicine he distributed to patients
without any charge. He has records of some of the cases.</p>

<p>Some two years ago a patient of mine asked me whether
we make any use of <i>Talápoka</i> (cockroach) in our Pharmacop&#339;ia.
My reply was that we use many loathsome insects
as our remedial agents. I told him also that <i>Blatta Americana</i>
(American cockroach), I had heard, had been used in
cases of dropsy, but I had no practical experience with it. He
then said the Indian cockroach is used in cases of asthma and
he knew several cases had been cured with it. This struck me
and I determined to try this in cases of asthma whenever next
opportunity occurred. For this purpose I got a lot of live
cockroaches, killed them and pounded to a fine pulp and
triturated according to class IX of American Hom&#339;opathic
Pharmacop&#339;ia, that is, two parts by weight of the substance
and nine parts by weight of sugar of milk, giving 1x trituration.
Thus I prepare up to 3x trituration and I also make an
alcoholic solution&mdash;a few live cockroaches were crushed and
five parts by weight of alcohol poured over them&mdash;it was allowed
to remain eight days in a dark, cool place, being shaken
twice daily. After the expiration of that period the alcoholic
solution was poured off, strained and filtered, when it was
ready for use.</p>

<p>I began to try both the preparations&mdash;drop doses of the
tincture and grain doses of 1x, 2x and sometimes 3x, 3 or
4 times daily when there was no fit and almost every fifteen
minutes or half hourly during the severity of a fit. Both
preparations began to answer well and I was getting daily
more and more encouraged about the efficacy of this new
drug. I had the opportunity of trying quite a number of
cases of asthma within this short time, the reports of which
I wish to publish in the future, but for the present I am glad
to say in many cases it acted almost specifically, that is, the
whole trouble cleared away within a fortnight or so without
recurrence. In some cases the severity of the paroxysm was
lessened and the recurrence of the fits took place at a longer<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>
interval; in others again only temporary benefit was observed.
This failure to benefit all cases alike I attribute to many circumstances.
Some people did not, rather could not, take the
medicine regularly according to my directions owing to their
untoward circumstances; some persons were suffering from
other complications along with asthma; some again got temporary
relief and in the meantime discontinued the medicine
and came back again when there was a recurrence of the fits,
that is, they did not continue the drug for sufficient length of
time. Some cases again, not having derived immediate benefit,
got impatient and discontinued the medicine without proper
trial.</p>

<p>Besides all these, I think individual idiosyncrasy has a great
deal to do. The season of the year has some influence. It
is usually observed in this country that those who are subject
to periodical attacks of asthmatic fits are more prone to an
attack either during the full or the new moon, or at both the
times. I believe if it is properly watched this fact will be
evident all over the world. Same is true of some other diseases,
as chronic cough, chronic fevers, rheumatism, either
acute or chronic, gout, elephantiasis, other glandular enlargements,
etc., get aggravated or are prone to aggravation during
such changes of the moon. Then some people get more
severe and frequent fits during the winter than the summer
and the others more during the summer than the winter. Let
me here tell you that the Indian summer is very different from
either the English or the American. Some part of the Indian
summer season is quite rainy and the atmosphere is saturated
with moisture and other irritating ingredients, consequently
a class of asthmatic people suffer more during this season. I
noticed to this class of cases <i>Blatta orientalis</i> will prove most
efficacious. I have used it in bronchial and nervous asthma
with better success than the stomachæ.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Second Paper.</span></p>

<p>I have of late tried <i>Blatta orientalis</i> indiscriminately in
almost all cases of asthma that have come under my treat<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>ment,
and I am glad to say I have received good results in
most cases, as the reports of some of the clinical cases will
show. I have not come to any definite use of this drug yet,
but I shall only mention a few facts that I have observed during
its use. It acts better in low potency and repeated doses
during an attack of asthma; when the spasm subsides, the
terminal asthmatic cough with wheezing and slight dyspn&#339;a,
etc., is better relieved with higher potencies; the low potency,
if continued after the spasmodic period is over, will
make the cough more troublesome and harassing to the
patient and the expectoration tenacious, thick and very difficult
to raise, but this will not be the case if the potency is
changed. I had this difficulty in a few cases when I was less
acquainted with the action of the drug, but now I manage
my cases better. In four patients who continued the drug
for some time in the low potency, during the paroxysm and
after it was over, the cough became dry and hacking with
little or no expectoration, the streaks of blood appeared in the
sputa, which the patients had never observed in the course of
their long illness. This appearance of blood in their sputa
was the cause of a great anxiety to them and made them
hurry over to my office. On inquiry I learned from two of
them&mdash;one a lady and the other a young man&mdash;that while
taking this remedy they felt a sensation all over the body, for
four or five days previous to the appearance of the blood, as if
heat were radiating from the ears, eyes, nose, top of the head,
palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They attributed
this sensation of heat all over the body and the appearance of
the blood in the expectoration to the drug. I directed them
to stop the medicine at once; this they did, and with the discontinuance
of it the blood disappeared from the sputa as well
as the sensation of heat, but to me it was an open question
whether this appearance of blood in the expectoration was
due to overdrugging, although I must say that the presence
of the streaks of blood in the sputa of asthmatic patients is
not an uncommon phenomenon. I resolved to give the same<span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>
potency to the same patients after the lapse of some days. I
did so, and to my surprise the blood-streaked sputa again appeared
after they had taken the remedy ix, one grain four
times daily. From this the patients understood it was the
same medicine that had been given to them on the last occasion
and begged me not to give it again, as the appearance of
blood in the sputum frightened them, in spite of all my assurance.
No more strong doses of the drug were given to them
and they did not notice any more blood in the sputum. I
have heard other patients complain of this peculiar sensation
of heat whenever strong doses were given to them for some
time. It acts better on stout and corpulent than on thin and
emaciated persons. The asthmatic patients subject to repeated
attacks of malaria derive less permanent benefit from
the use of the drug. So, it seems to me, that in hæmic
asthma, which is due to the abnormal condition of the blood,
it is efficacious. I have also used this drug in troublesome
cough with dyspn&#339;a of phthisical patients with good result.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clinical Cases.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case I.</span> Baln R. M., aged fifty-five, thin, emaciated and
irritable temperament, has been suffering from hereditary
asthma for the last twenty-five years. For the last six or
seven years he suffered from asthmatic fits almost nightly and
a troublesome cough with a good deal of frothy expectoration.
He said he had not known what sleep was for the last six or
seven years, in fact, he could not lie down in bed, as that
would immediately bring on a violent fit of coughing which
would not cease until he sat up, so the recumbent posture for
him was almost impracticable, and he used to sit up during
the night and doze on a pile of pillows. He passed his days
comparatively better, but the approach of the night was a
horror to him, his struggle, commencing at 9 or 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
would last till the morning. He was the father of many
children and was well taken care of, but his suffering was so
great that he had no ambition to live any longer. He tried<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>
almost all systems of medicine without much good. For the
last ten years he took opium, which afforded him slight relief
at the beginning, using as high as forty-eight grains of opium
in twenty-four hours. Owing to the constant sitting posture
he became stooped, and the back of his neck stiff and painful.
In April, 1889, he was suddenly taken ill with fever. The
fever became protracted. After an illness of over a month his
condition became so bad that all hope of his recovery was
given up. During this illness he was treated by an old
school physician of some repute, but his condition daily grew
worse, the asthmatic attacks became very violent and almost
incessant, and the difficulty of breathing very great. He became
so feeble that he had not strength enough to enable
him to bring up the expectoration; his chest was full of it;
fever was less; there was general anasarca. He was sitting
with head bent forward, almost touching the bed, as that was
the only position possible to him day and night. He had become
almost speechless, when I was sent for, at about 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
on the 23d of May, 1889. When I was entering the patient's
room a medical man came out and hinted that there was no
use of my going in as the patient was just expiring. I found
the patient breathing hard; unconscious; jaws were locked
and saliva dribbling from the corners of his mouth; body
cold; cold, clammy perspiration on forehead; eyes partially
opened; in fact, to all appearance, he looked as if he were
dead, except for the respiratory movements. I felt his pulse
and found it was not so bad as the patient was looking. I
examined the back of his chest, as that was the only portion
easily accessible, and noticed that the bronchial spasms were
going on with loud mucous râle. From the character of his
pulse I thought that the present state of the patient was
<i>probably</i> due to the continued violent struggle and not deep
coma, and that he had become so exhausted that he was
motionless, speechless and completely unconscious. His bed
was surrounded by many friends and relations, who had come
to bid him a last farewell; and it was with surprise that they<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>
all looked at me when I proposed to administer medicine to a
patient whose death was expected every minute and for whose
cremation preparations were being made.</p>

<p>I got a big phial full of water and put in it <i>Blatta orientalis</i>
1x trit. a few grains and tried two or three times to give him
a spoonful of it, but in vain; the jaws were locked and I
could not make him swallow any of that medicine; then I
put some powder dry in the hollow of his lips and asked the
attendants to try to give him the medicine I left in the bottle.
I was asked whether there was any hope of his recovery, of
course my answer was "<i>no</i>," and I also said he could only
live a few hours. I left the patient's house with the idea of
not visiting it again, but at 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> a messenger came with
the report that the patient was slightly better, he could swallow
medicine and two doses of it had been given. I was
asked to see the patient again. I could hardly believe what
he said, however, I went to see the patient again. I noticed
there was a slight change for the better, the pulse was steady,
the jaws were unlocked, there was mobility of the limbs, he
could swallow liquid with ease and was expectorating freely,
the breathing though still difficult was slightly improved.
There was the winking of the eyelids. On the whole he was
looking less lifeless, but still I entertained no hope of his
recovery. I left instructions to repeat the same medicine
once or twice during the night, if required, at the same time
to give milk repeatedly, one or two spoonfuls at a time, and
to inform me next morning if he had survived the night.
Next morning I really grew anxious to know what had become
of my patient who had shown symptoms slightly better
with this new remedy. A messenger came with the report
that the patient passed a good night. I was requested to see
him again. When I arrived at his place at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I was
surprised to see him so much better, he had not only regained
his consciousness, but was sitting quietly in his bed, could
speak slowly, the difficulty of breathing was completely gone,
but the cough occasionally troubled him and a good deal of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>
expectoration of frothy white or sometimes of big yellowish
lumps of mucus came up. He was given three doses of the
same medicine 2x trit. during the day. He passed a fair day,
but at night his difficulty of breathing again appeared in
somewhat milder form. He had to take two doses of the
medicine. Thus the medicine was continued for a week and
his trouble daily became less and less until after the expiration
of a week he was able to sleep at night for the first time
in the last six or seven years. I treated him over a month,
and his health improved so rapidly that he not only got rid
of the asthmatic trouble, but was soon able to go out and
even attend his business. The stooped condition of his neck
with slight pain and slight chronic bronchitis did not leave
him altogether. Besides <i>Blatta orientalis</i>, I also prescribed
for him <i>Arsenicum alb. 6</i> and <i>12</i>, <i>Naja tri. 6</i>, <i>Ipecac 3</i>, and
<i>Antim. tart. 3</i>, as they were indicated. He continued well
for over a year, but in August, 1890, he had slight reappearance
of the asthmatic trouble. He again took <i>Blatta orientalis</i>
and got well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case II.</span> Mrs. Nundy, a thin lady, aged twenty-three,
mother of three children, came from a village for the treatment
of asthma, from which she had been suffering for the
last eight years. For the first two or three years she used to
get two or three attacks in the year, but gradually they were
repeated more frequently, though the character of the attack
remained the same throughout. It would last two days and
two nights, whether any medicine was given to her or not.
Nothing would alleviate her suffering during an attack&mdash;too
much interference would increase her sufferings and prolong
the duration of the attack, so, practically speaking, almost
nothing was given to her during an attack. The great oppression
of breathing, restlessness, profuse perspiration, inability
to move or lie down and loud wheezing would be
the most prominent symptoms in each attack. These would remain
almost with equal violence for nearly forty hours, when
the spasms would cease with slight cough and expectoration,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>
and she would be perfectly at ease as ever, and there would be
no trace of disease left, except slight wheezing sound on auscultation.
But latterly these attacks were very frequent,
almost every week or ten days. In August, 1890, she was
brought here for treatment. It is worth while to mention
that she took both allopathic and native drugs during the interval
of attacks to prevent their recurrence, but without any
effect. I saw her first on the morning of the 5th of August,
during an attack. I prescribed <i>Blatta Orientalis</i> <span class="smcap">IX</span> trit., one
grain every two hours. It was to their surprise that this attack
subsided unlike all others by the evening; that is, it
disappeared within twenty hours. This encouraged the lady
and her husband so much that she wanted to have regular
course of treatment under me. I put her under tincture of
<i>Blatta Orientalis</i> <span class="smcap">IX</span>, one drop per dose, twice daily. She
continued this medicine till the time of the next attack was
over; that is, for ten days. After the expiration of this
period she began to complain of a sensation of heat all over
her body, so I changed it to 3x, one drop morning and evening.
She kept well, and after a month she went home thinking
she got well. A month after her going home she had an
attack of asthma at night and took <i>Blatta Orientalis</i> <span class="smcap">IX</span> as
before, and by the next morning she was well. This was in
October, and after two months of the last attack. She had
another attack in winter and none since.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case III.</span> A young man, aged thirty-four, had been suffering
from asthma for some years. He was invariably worse
during the rains and the winter, and a chronic bronchitis was
almost a constant accompaniment. He tried allopathic and
lots of patent drugs, with only temporary amelioration of the
trouble. At last, in November, 1888, he came to my office.
On examination of his chest I found there was a chronic
bronchitis. He said that slight difficulty of breathing with
hacking cough used to trouble him every night, besides a cold
would be followed by a severe attack of asthma, so its periodicity
of recurrence was irregular. I treated him with <i>Ipecac</i>,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>
<i>Arsenicum alb.</i>, etc. The first-named medicine did him the
most good, but he never got entirely well. So in July, 1889,
I put him under tincture <i>Blatta orientalis</i> <span class="smcap">3x</span>, drop doses,
three or four times daily. Under its use he began to improve
steadily, and had only two or three attacks of asthmatic fits
since he used this drug, which were promptly relieved by the
same drug in 1x potency. <i>Euphrasia off.</i> was prescribed for
his cold whenever he had it. He is free from all trouble for
the last year and a half. His general condition is so much
changed that there is no apprehension of the recurrence of
his former illness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case IV.</span> Baln Bose, an old, corpulent gentleman, aged
sixty-two, has been suffering from asthmatic attacks for some
years. He never took any allopathic medicine, but had
always been under treatment of native kabiraj (medical men),
under whose treatment he was sometimes better and worse at
others. Latterly he became very bad and passed several
sleepless nights. He used to pass his days comparatively better,
and it was at night and in the morning he used to be
worse. On the 24th of July, 1890, at 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I saw him first&mdash;there
was a slight touch of asthma even then. I made him
try to lie down in bed; this he could not do, owing to the
coughing fit it excited while in that posture. On examination
the chest revealed chronic bronchial catarrh, and there
was also a harassing cough, with very little expectoration
after repeated exertion. I prescribed <i>Blatta orientalis</i> <span class="smcap">IX</span>
trit., one grain every two hours. He passed the night without
an attack, and the next morning when I saw him he complained
that only the cough was troublesome last night and
no fit of asthma. The cough was somewhat troublesome even
when I saw him in the morning. I gave him tincture <i>Blatta
ori.</i> 3x, one drop dose every two hours. He passed the day
and night well. He continued the treatment for a fortnight
and then went home, where he has been keeping good health,
with the exception of an occasional bronchial catarrh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case V.</span> A shoemaker, aged forty-two, robust constitution,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>
has been suffering with asthma for three or four years. He
came to my office on the 6th of November, 1890. He had
been getting asthmatic fits almost every night since October
last. During the day troublesome cough, with slight expectoration
and hurried breathing made him unable to attend his
business. Tincture <i>Blatta orientalis</i> <span class="smcap">IX</span>, one drop doses, six
times daily, was given. The very first day he perceived the
good effect of the medicine and continued the same for a
month, when he got well and discontinued the medicine. He
has been keeping well ever since.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case VI.</span> Mr. G., aged forty, healthy constitution, had
an asthmatic fit on the 4th of August, 1890, preceded by a
violent attack of cold, from which he frequently used to
suffer. He had this severe cold in the morning, and in the
afternoon he began to experience a great difficulty of breathing
and slight oppression and lightness of the chest&mdash;this, by
9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, developed into a regular fit of asthma. I was sent for.
On my arrival, at 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, I found he was sitting before a
pile of pillows with elbows supported on them, and struggling
for breath. There was also a great tightness in the chest,
occasional cough, and inability to speak. I at once put him
under <i>Blatta orientalis</i> <span class="smcap">IX</span> trit., one grain every fifteen minutes,
and less frequently afterwards if he felt better. On my
visit next morning I found him much better, but he said his
trouble at night continued, more or less, till 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, after
which he got some rest. Now, there was a troublesome
cough, slight oppression of the chest and great apprehension
of a second attack in the night. The same medicine, 3x
trit., was given to him during the day, and a few powders of
1x were left with him in case he was to get an attack at
night. There was a slight aggravation of those symptoms at
night, and he had occasion to take only two powders of 1x.
The next morning he was every way better, except the cough,
for which four powders of 3x were given daily. In four or
five days he got entirely well and had no relapse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case VII.</span> Mrs. D., aged twenty, a healthy, stout lady,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>
mother of one child, had been always enjoying good health,
was suddenly attacked with a violent fit of asthma on the 8th
of August, 1890. This was the first occasion she had a fit of
asthma, the result of a severe cold. At about 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> she was
suddenly seized with difficulty of breathing and a great oppression
in the chest. She could not lie down any longer in
bed and had to sit up, being supported on a pile of pillows.
In the morning at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I saw her first. I noticed she was
in great agony and almost speechless. On examination I
could not detect much loud wheezing&mdash;the characteristic
of an asthmatic attack&mdash;though the rapid movements of the
walls of the chest were even quite visible to the bystanders.
The patient was feeling almost choked up, and could not express
what was going on. She only pointed out a point, a
little over the pit of the stomach most painful. There was no
cough&mdash;perspiration was pouring over her body. I could not
at once make out whether it was a case of pure asthma, especially
as she never had it before. However, I made up my
mind to give her <i>Blatta orientalis</i> <span class="smcap">IX</span> trit., a grain dose every
fifteen minutes, and watch the effect myself. Three doses of
it were given without much change for the better. I left a
few more doses to be repeated half hourly and promised to see
her again within a couple of hours. On my return I found
her in a much better condition, and she had taken only one of
those powders I had left, and they were not repeated, as she
felt better. Now I thought it must have been an attack of
asthma, and I continued the medicine unhesitatingly. There
was no aggravation at night, but on the next morning she was
better, and the usual asthmatic cough began with slight expectoration.
There was pain in the chest and head with each
coughing fit. <i>Blatta orientalis</i> 3x trit., four to six doses,
was continued for a few days, when she got well. Again in
November she had a slight tendency to an asthmatic fit, took
two or three doses of the same medicine and got well. Since
then she had not been troubled again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case VIII.</span> A gentleman, the keeper of a common shop,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>
aged forty-four, belonging to a village, had been suffering from
asthma for the last eight years and had always been under
treatment of native kabiraj (medical men). In June, he came
to the city, and I was called to see him on the 14th of June,
to treat him for his asthma. The day previous he had an
attack, for which he took no medicine. Each of his attacks
usually lasted four or five days. I gave him <i>Blatta orientalis</i>
<span class="smcap">IX</span> trit., one grain every two hours, and left him six such powders
to be taken during the day. He took them and felt better
the next day. He stayed here two or three days more, and
when well he wanted to proceed home, which was some
couple of hundred miles. He took with him two two-drachm
phials of <i>Blatta orientalis</i>, one of <span class="smcap">IX</span> and the other of 3x
trit. He continued the 3x, one grain doses, two or three times
daily, for a month, and discontinued afterward. He had no
more asthmatic fits. In January last, 1891, I had a letter from
him, thanking me for his recovery and asking for some of the
same medicine for a friend of his, who had been suffering
from asthma. The friend of his who used the same drug,
<i>Blatta orientalis</i>, was equally benefited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case IX.</span> Mrs. Dalta, a thin lady, aged thirty-eight,
mother of several children, had been exposed to cold, which
brought on an attack of bronchitis with fever. This, in the
course of a fortnight, developed into a regular fit of asthma.
She was all this time treated by an old-school physician, but
when the husband of the lady saw that she was daily getting
worse, and a new disease crept in, he made up his mind to
change the treatment. I was called to see her in the morning
of the 8th of June, 1890. She became very much emaciated,
could not take any food, had fever with acute bronchitis, hurried
respiration, difficulty of breathing; this she was complaining
of bitterly, owing to which she could not lie down in
bed, but had to sit up day and night. There was a prolonged
fit of spasmodic cough at short intervals, with slight expectoration,
but these coughing fits would make her almost
breathless. This was the first time I prescribed <i>Blatta orientalis</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">IX</span> in a case of asthma with fever and acute bronchitis.
It answered my purpose well. She had only ten powders
during the day and passed a comparatively better night. Next
morning when I saw her she was better, except the coughing
fits, which were continuing as before. The same medicine
was repeated. On the 10th of June she had no asthmatic
trouble at night, but there was not much improvement in her
cough&mdash;<i>Anti. tart.</i> and <i>Bryonia</i> were needed to complete the
cure.</p>

November 4th. For the last five weeks has had the
ague. At first it was a simple quotidian. Took Quinine,
which broke it for four days, when it returned; took Quinine
in massive doses, which checked it for one week. It returned
two weeks since, in the form of a double quotidian. The chill
comes on every day at 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>The chill lasts from one to two hours each time; hands and
feet get icy cold, chills run up and down the spine, with severe
pains in the head, back and limbs; followed by high fever
for three hours, and then profuse sweat. Tongue furred
whitish-yellow, with large fissures in the tongue; flat, bitter
taste; has had no appetite for five weeks; craves cold water
all the time; bowels rather costive; has nausea during every<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>
chill, but no vomiting; very weak, can only sit up about one
hour in the morning; great depression of spirits, cries during
the whole examination; face very much jaundiced. Treatment:
<i>Ars. 2</i>, every two hours, for three days. It produced
constant nausea and lessened the chills, but aggravated the
fever. I then determined to try the <i>Boletus</i> 1st, two grs. every
two hours. Took two doses when the chills came on, she then
ceased to take the medicine until 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Took three doses,
and then fell asleep. 8th. Says she is feeling a little better,
continued treatment; 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, commenced to have a severe
diarrh&#339;a, an effect of the medicine; discontinued the powders
until 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The fever did not come on until 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>; had no
chill; fever lasted three hours; perspired profusely all night;
slept well for the first time in a number of weeks. 9th. Feeling
much better. Fever came on at 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, had no chill;
fever lasted four hours; nausea all the evening; sweat all
night. 10th. Feeling quite well. Had no more fever, but
had night sweats for a week after. Convalescence was very
slow; notwithstanding she had no more fever it was three
weeks before she felt perfectly well.</p>

<p>This case demonstrates the fact to us that the <i>Boletus</i> is
superior to our <i>greatest remedial</i> agents in the case of intermittents.
I believe if I had not been acquainted with the
therapeutic properties of the <i>Boletus</i> I would have been compelled
to treat this lady every few weeks for two or three
months with our usual remedies.</p>

<p>My professional engagements do not permit me to spend
much time in writing; the following case, however, I deem
worthy of note.</p>

<p>Born of healthy parents, I remained quite healthy until my
twenty-third year. I had no trouble in getting over the diseases
to which children are generally liable. Some of them,
scarlet fever and measles, attacked me when I was already
engaged in my professional career. I am now fifty-seven years
old.</p>

<p>In the year 1808, while vaccinating children, I caught the
itch from one of them. Although I washed myself with soap
water immediately, yet a pustule made its appearance in
about eight days, between the little finger and ring finger of
the left hand; afterwards a few more came on at the same
place and some others between the ring and middle finger. I
hastened to repel this eruption as fast as possible, which I unfortunately
succeeded in doing within the period of eight days.</p>

<p>This suppression of the eruption was followed by a host of
diseases: Liability to catching cold; frequent catarrh; rheumatic
complaints; toothache; attacks of hemicrania, with
vomiting; continual heartburn; hæmorrhoidal complaints, at
times tumors, at times fluent; excessive emaciation; afterwards
a pustulous eruption over the whole body; painful
swelling of the joints, arthritic nodosities in different places;
a copper-colored eruption in the face, especially on and about
the nose, which made me look like a confirmed drunkard,
etc., etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>These affections tormented me more or less, until in the year
1833 I visited Hahnemann at Coethen, for the purpose of
studying hom&#339;opathia with him. Hahnemann treated me for
three weeks, and I continued the treatment at my native
place. My health improved steadily, and at the end of a year
I considered myself cured. This lasted until October, 1836,
when I was attacked with violent colic in one night. The
pain was felt in the region of the left kidney, lancinating,
pinching, sore; retching ensued, resulting in vomiting of
mucus, and lastly bile. I took a few pellets of <i>Nux v.</i> x;
after this the pain disappeared gradually, and the vomiting
ceased. Next day I was well again. Two days afterwards I
discovered gravel in the urine, and my sufferings had vanished.</p>

<p>One year elapsed in this way; however, I occasionally experienced
an uncomfortable sensation in the region of the left
kidney, especially when riding on horseback, driving in a carriage,
or walking fast; I took at times <i>Lycopod.</i>, at times <i>Nux
v.</i>, in proportion as one or the other of these two remedies appeared
indicated.</p>

<p>In November, 1837, I was suddenly attacked with vomiting,
accompanied with violent lancinating, sore or pinching
pains in the region of the left kidney. The horrible anguish
and pain which I experienced extorted from me involuntary
screams; I was writhing like a worm in the dust. A calculus
had descended into the ureter and had become incarcerated in
it. Repeated doses of <i>Nux</i> relieved the incarceration, and I
distinctly felt that the calculus was descending towards the
bladder. After twenty-four hours of horrible suffering the
vomiting ceased, the pain became duller and was felt in the
region where the ureter dips into and becomes interwoven
with the tissue of the bladder: it continued for three days and
then disappeared all of a sudden (the stone had not got into
the bladder). Thirty-six hours afterwards the calculus entered
the bulb of the urethra. I felt a frequent desire to urinate;
the urine was turbid and bloody, until at last a calculus of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>
four grains made its appearance in the urine. After this I
frequently passed gravel and calculi, at times with slight, at
times violent pains, sometimes accompanied with vomiting;
I kept the larger calculi, with a view of using them hereafter
as a curative agent.</p>

<p>Professor Nasse, of Bonn, where my son studied medicine
at the time, has analyzed the calculi, and has found them to
be urate of lime. He advised me to take <i>Merc. dulcis</i> and
the <i>Sulphate of Soda</i> for some time; it is scarcely necessary
for me to say that I did not follow his advice.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of February, 1839, I felt the precursory
symptoms of a new attack, which really did break out in all
its fury on the 16th, and continued on the 17th and 18th. I
now caused 5 grains of my calculi to be triturated in my
presence with 95 grains of sugar of milk, according to the
fashion of Hahnemann, and took 1/2 grain in the evening of
the 17th, another 1/2 grain in the morning of the 18th. On
this day I passed very turbid urine with a considerable quantity
of gravel; however, in the region where the ureter dips
into the bladder, I experienced an uncomfortable sensation,
but was well otherwise. On the 19th I was obliged to visit
a patient at the distance of two miles; on my journey I felt
that the calculus was descending into the bladder; the urine
which I emitted shortly afterwards was very turbid and
bloody. That same evening, after returning home, I felt the
stone in the bulb of the urethra, and on the morning of the
20th it came off during stool, but unfortunately got lost among
the excrement. To judge from my feeling it must have been
larger than any of the preceding calculi, and also rougher,
for its passage through the urethra was very painful and followed
by an oozing out of blood.</p>

<p>The uncomfortable feeling in the region of the left kidney
never disappeared completely; it became especially painful
when pressing upon that place, when riding on horseback or
in a carriage, when taking exercise or turning the body. It
seems to me that the whole pelvis of the kidneys must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
been full of gravel and calculi. I now took 1/2 grain at intervals
of eight days; the result was that I passed gravel and
small calculi at every micturition. On the 30th of November
my condition got worse, and I continued to take 1/2 grain of
<i>Calc. ren. præp.</i>, at longer or shorter intervals, until October
18th, 1840. After this period I ceased to pass any gravel, and
I felt entirely well. On the 3d of February I passed some
more gravel. Another dose of 1/2 grain of <i>Lapis renalis</i>;
another dose on June 3d. On June 17th precursors of another
attack; on the 18th vomiting accompanied by all the frightful
circumstances which I have detailed above; the vomiting
of mucus, bile, ingesta, continued at short intervals until the
26th; my tongue was coated with yellow mucus, and my appetite
had completely disappeared. <i>Bryon., Nux v.</i> and <i>Pulsat.</i>
relieved the gastric symptom; on the 26th, in the afternoon,
I passed a calculus of the size of a pea. I now resume the
use of <i>Calc. ren. præp.</i> in 1/2 grain doses, at irregular intervals.
On the 23d of October I passed a calculus of the size
of a pea, without vomiting; there were no other precursory
symptoms except the uncomfortable feeling in the region of
the kidney a few days previous. I have felt well ever since
and free from all complaint, although I continue the occasional
use of 1/2 a grain of <i>Calc. ren. præp.</i>, lest I should have
a relapse.</p>

<p>Every time I took a dose of <i>Calc. ren. pr.</i> I found that the
so-called tartar on the teeth became detached a few days afterwards.
A short while ago a nodosity, hard as a stone, which
had appeared on the extensor tendon of the right middle
finger, about nine months ago, and which threatened to increase
more and more, disappeared. I consider the tartar on
the teeth, calculi renales and arthritic nodosities very similar
morbid products.</p>

<p>In conclusion I beg leave to offer the following remarks:</p>

<p>1. Hahnemann's theory of psora is no chimera, as many
theoreticians would have us believe. I was perfectly healthy
previous to my being infected with itch. What a host of suf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>ferings
have I been obliged to endure after the suppression of
the itch!</p>

<p>2. Isopathy deserves especial notice.</p>

<p>It is true, the most suitable hom&#339;opathic remedies afforded
me relief; the incarceration of calculi in the ureter especially
was relieved by <i>Nux</i>; but they were unable to put a stop to
the formation of calculi; this result was only attained by the
preparation of <i>Calc. ren.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>(The following by Dr. Majumdar in <i>Indian Hom&#339;pathic Review</i>, 1897,
illustrates the chief use of this "organ remedy.")</p></blockquote>


<p>Recently I had a wonderful case of supposed heart disease
cured by <i>Ceanothus</i>. I am indebted to my friend, Dr. Burnett,
for the suggestion of using <i>Ceanothus</i>.</p>

<p>A thin and haggard looking young man presented himself
to my office on the 26th of July, 1896. He told me he had
some disease of the heart and had been under the treatment
of several eminent allopathic physicians of this city; some
declared it to be a case of hypertrophy of the heart and some
of valvular disease.</p>

<p>Without asking him further, I examined his heart thoroughly,
but with no particular results. The rhythm and
sounds were all normal only there was a degree of weakness
in these sounds. Dulness on percussion was not extended
beyond its usual limit. So I could not make out any heart
disease in this man.</p>

<p>On further inquiry, I learned that the man remained in a
most malarious place for five years, during which he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
suffering off and on from intermittent fever. I percussed the
abdomen and found an enormously enlarged and indurated
spleen, reaching beyond the navel and pushing up the thoracic
viscera.</p>

<p>The patient complained of palpitation of heart, dyspn&#339;a,
especially on ascending steps and walking fast. I thought
from these symptoms his former medical advisers concluded
heart disease. In my mind they seemed to be resulted from
enlarged spleen.</p>

<p>On that very day I gave him six powders of <i>Ceonothus
Amer.</i> 3x, one dose morning and evening. I asked him to see
me when his medicine finished. He did not make his appearance,
however, on the appointed day. I thought the result
of my prescription was not promising. After a week he came
and reported unusually good results.</p>

<p>His dyspn&#339;a was gone, palpitation troubled him now and
then, but much less than before. He wanted me to give him
the same powders. I gave him <i>Sac. lac.</i>, six doses, in the
usual way.</p>

<p>Reported further improvement; the same powders of <i>Sac.
lac.</i> twice. To my astonishment I found the spleen much reduced
in size and softened than before; I knew nothing about
this patient for some time. Only recently I saw him, a perfect
picture of sound health. He informed me that the same
powders were sufficient to set him right. He gained health;
no sign of enlarged spleen left.</p>

<p>Alternations of symptoms of mind and bodily pains. When

and one feels better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;In looking over the above proving we find a
number of illustrations of the alternate action of the drug.
But perhaps what strikes the reader most forcibly is the way
the symptoms follow Reuter's series. The most prominent
symptoms early developed, catarrhal and gastric, have come
and gone within three or four days, while those affecting the
chest, heart, sensorium, eyes, brain, and nerves are more slowly
developed, and are the ones that persist. Another thing to
be noticed is the long duration of its action. The high-water
mark in regard to its action was not reached (I mean its action
on the nervous system) until nearly ten days after discontinuing
to take it. It is an <i>antipsoric</i> of remarkable power. Some
skin symptoms developed by it persisted off and on for years,
two or three of which I will mention. "Itching of the right
popliteal space," this after continuing for eight or nine years
disappeared. I think some <i>Sepia</i><span class="num">&#953;&#960;</span>&nbsp; I took had something to
do with its disappearance. Another: "Itching with roughness
of the skin, like eczema, above the left knee anteriorly."
This still persists. I still have "Itching, with an eruption
resembling at times herpes zoster below the left scapula."
This is still present, although annoying. I have done nothing
to cause its disappearance.</p>

<p>In regard to <i>verifications</i> I could report a goodly number.
One of the first I ever had was a case of eczema of both hands,
extending as far as the elbows. Cured in six weeks. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
provings point in the direction of kidney troubles, and I have
seen it speedily cause the disappearance of deposits in the
urine that were giving much inconvenience. In a case of
dropsy of cardiac and renal origin (albuminuria) in which
there was great &#339;dema, cured in two or three weeks. Sleeplessness,
peculiar in its nature, corresponding to the proving,
is relieved by it. Intercostal neuralgia, especially on left side.
Anterior crural neuralgia, an aggravated case, promptly relieved.
I need not say that the symptoms strongly point to
rheumatism. I could say much on that part of the subject,
and there is the sphere in which it has seemed to have been
useful by the professional friend to whom I have furnished the
medicine for trial. In a monograph by Dr. R. E. Kunge, of
New York, and the writer, I ventured the prediction that
<i>Cereus bonplandii</i> would prove of value in the treatment of
insanity. I send you the report of two cases. I have one
other still under treatment. A patient for fourteen years in
the Middletown Insane Hospital, improving, called to see Ida
Reamer, a young woman of eighteen, living in New Scotland,
on what is called the Heldeberg Mountain or hill, on the
evening of April 19th, 1884. For some time previously she
had been living with a relative in Albany, attending school
and assisting in household labor. Had studied hard and
probably overtaxed her strength. Her friends noticing that
she was not her former self, and that though usually amiable
and cheerful, she had become gloomy and taciturn, brought
her home. Rest did her no good, and I was called after she
had been home for some time. On my visit I noticed she
would not answer questions; was wandering aimlessly about
the house; could not sit still, if seated, more than a few minutes.
During my visit I think she changed her position a
dozen or fifteen times. She would go to the water pail and
get a drink, then in a minute or two would get up and go to
the door. After standing a minute or two she would come in
and sit down, only to rise up and repeat her restless wanderings.
I could elicit nothing from the mother of anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
wrong in regard to the menstrual function. Prescribed <i>Cereus
bonplandii</i>, fourth decimal. Did not call again, but was informed
by her friend that she soon regained her health. Was
requested to call again to see Ida R. on November 29th of the
same year. This time there was considerable mental disturbance;
she had attended some entertainment which she had
considered of a questionable nature, and had been worrying
over it. Although living out at service, it did not appear
that she had overworked. I found her sitting still; she would
sit for hours. If any one disturbed her, she would curse,
swear, throw boots and shoes or anything that came in her
way, resisted attempts made by her friends to remove her to
her home. Prescribed <i>Cer. bon.</i> 4. Saw her December 3d,
7th, 10th, at the end of which time she was entirely free from
any mental manifestations, and although under observation
has never experienced a return of them to the present date.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1879 was consulted in the case of Mrs. D.
V., afflicted with melancholia for a year or two. The disease
had appeared just subsequent to her confinement with her last
child. Prescribed wholesome advice in regard to mode of life,
etc., and very little medicine. In a few months she was apparently
as well as ever. June 5th, 1884, was called to see Mrs.
D. V. She had quite recently given birth to a child and was
developing delusions, most of which were those of a spiritual
nature. She thought she had committed the unpardonable
sin, or that she had offended some of her friends, and was constantly
worrying. Appetite very poor. Prescribed <i>Cer. bon.</i> 4,
gave her nourishing diet with Maltine and Pepsin to aid digestion.
On July 11th she was about the house attending to
her household duties.</p>

<p>Monday, July 10, 1882, 9:30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, I took one drop of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span>
tincture, after having taken the 12x and 6x potencies, one day
each, without any effect. I continued taking the tincture
each hour during the day, increasing each dose one drop till
five were reached, then increased each dose five drops till
twenty-five were reached, but without any effect whatever.</p>

<p>Tuesday, July 11th, I began with thirty drops at 9 o'clock
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and increased the dose five drops each hour till I
reached one drachm, and took three doses of one drachm
each. I retired at 10 o'clock feeling perfectly well.</p>

<p>I awoke at 4:10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, Wednesday, July 12th, with a severe
headache&mdash;chiefly in the forehead and just over the eyes&mdash;especially
the left eye. Eyeballs exceedingly painful, feel
sore and bruised.</p>

<p>Cutting twisting pains all through my abdomen.</p>

<p>I turned over and lay with my face downward, which
seemed to relieve the abdominal pains some, and after awhile
I went to sleep. I awoke again at 8:20 feeling very sick and
badly all over. Head feels very sore all over and through it;
heavy dull feeling in forehead and a drawing or pressing at
the root of my nose. I felt so weak I had to sit down awhile
before I could finish dressing; <i>never</i> before felt so sick at my
stomach. Bitter eructations, great nausea and retching, with
a desire for stool.</p>

<p>I finished dressing and looked at my tongue, which was
heavily coated and of a dirty, greenish yellow color. I started
down stairs and had a violent attack of nausea and a great
deal of retching before I could vomit. It seemed as though
there were a "<i>double suction</i>" in my abdomen, one trying to
force something up and the other sucking it back, till finally,
by quite an effort, I vomited a teacup full, or more, of <i>very
dark green</i> bile, rather ropy, <i>I think</i>, and exceedingly bitter.
The bile came up with a single gush and I was through.
Immediately a cold perspiration broke out and stood in beads
on my forehead, and I felt very weak. Desire for stool gone
after vomiting.</p>

<p>I have a sore, weak, bruised feeling all over the small of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>
my back; feels very weak when standing or moving about;
better sitting or lying down.</p>

<p>No appetite for breakfast, but my stomach felt so weak and
empty that I drank a cup of coffee and ate half a biscuit,
which relieved to some extent.</p>

<p>9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, am so nervous I cannot keep still and can hardly
write down my symptoms.</p>

<p>9:30 o'clock, my back in lumbar and sacral region is so
sore and weak I could hardly walk from the car to the office,
every step seemed to jar my whole body and made my headache
worse.</p>

<p>10 o'clock, have been quiet for half an hour and feel some
better; have a pressing or squeezing sensation in the bridge
of my nose; sore constricted feeling in the temples, with
throbbing temporal arteries.</p>

<p>10:30 o'clock, just came from stool; the first passed was
watery, but the last was more solid in appearance; stool terribly
offensive, like <i>carrion</i>. Heavy, all-gone sort of feeling
low down in hypogastrium; color of stool was dark brown
with pieces of undigested food in it.</p>

<p>11:30, just got home and feel very bad and weak. My
head and back ache considerably, and I feel "played out"
generally.</p>

<p>12 o'clock, forehead and cheeks <i>very</i> hot and dry, radial
pulse 114, chilly sensation darting through body from front
to back, causing a sort of shivering or involuntary jerking,
forehead feels like a hot coal of fire to my hand; headache in
forehead and over eyes relieved by pressing with my hand,
but I cannot bear it long for my head seems to get hotter
from it; am exceedingly nervous, cannot lie still, involuntary
jerkings in different parts of the body. Roof of mouth
and tongue feel very dry, although there seems to be the
usual amount of saliva present. No thirst at all.</p>

<p>I went to sleep about 12:20 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and was awakened at 2
o'clock for dinner. Couldn't eat anything; I tried but it
nauseated me; could only drink a cup of coffee; headache<span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>
worse after waking; pulse 88; head not quite so hot, body
feels chilly, and I had a shawl thrown over me; went to sleep
again about 3:30.</p>

<p>I was told that at 4:15 my face and head were covered with
a profuse perspiration, and my carotid arteries pulsated very
hard and rapidly; I got up at 5 o'clock and bathed my face
in cold water and felt somewhat better, though my head and
back still ache considerably and feel quite sore; eyeballs feel
bruised.</p>

<p>6:30. Weak, empty feeling about stomach, which was relieved
for awhile by eating some crackers and drinking a cup
of coffee. Pulse still 88.</p>

<p>At 8:15 had an action from my bowels; during stool griping
and cutting pains in abdomen, about and below umbilicus;
stool thin, watery, blackish-brown color and very offensive.
I retired at 9:30 and had to have an extra covering
thrown upon me, I was so chilly, while my room-mate lay
without any covering at all. My head feels sore and bruised
all over, and the small of my back is exceedingly weak and
feels, when I touch it with my hand, as though the skin were
all off.</p>

<p>Thursday, July 13th. I was very nervous and restless last
night after going to bed; didn't go to sleep till after 12 o'clock,
and woke up several times before daylight with pains in my
head, abdomen and back. Got up at 8 o'clock. My head
feels sore and bruised; the bruised feeling seems to go into
my brain now; every time I move, cough or laugh it seems
as if my head would split open and fly in every direction;
my <i>back</i> is not so painful this morning; I couldn't eat much
breakfast; stool this morning was quite copious, watery, <i>dark</i>
brown and not so offensive as yesterday.</p>

<p>9:30. Headache better; several times this morning I have
had attacks of cutting or griping pains in my intestines, in and
about the umbilical region; my tongue is very heavily coated
in the centre with a thick yellowish fur; the tip is slightly
red, and on each side of the tip there are several little places<span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>
that look as though blood was about to ooze forth from them;
my tongue feels drawn and shriveled up the centre.</p>

<p>4:30. The only symptom at 11 o'clock was a dull, sore,
aching feeling in the umbilical and iliac regions, occasionally
changing for just a minute or so to a severe griping, which
was relieved some by emission of flatus. My face has a yellowish
appearance; from the outer to the inner canthus there
is a reddish-yellow streak, about one-quarter of an inch wide,
in the whites of both eyes; the blood vessels of the sclerotic
coat are very much enlarged and distinctly visible.</p>

<p>Friday, July 14th. I suffered considerably after 5 o'clock
yesterday afternoon and last night with pains in my abdomen,
and they are more severe this morning than yesterday; it feels
just like a string tied in a "slip knot" around my intestines
in the umbilical region, and every once in awhile it was <i>suddenly</i>
drawn tight for a minute or so, and then <i>gradually</i>
loosened; stool this morning was very thin, watery and rather
flaky; the flaky portion was dark yellow, the fluid portion
<i>dark</i> green, with a <i>light</i> green foam or froth on top, streaked
with a white, mucus-looking substance; flatus and fæces
passed together; some pain in my bowels during stool, and a
hot, scalded sensation in anus, which lasted fifteen or twenty
minutes after stool; during stool a cold perspiration broke
out on my forehead and back of my hands; took quite a while
to pass stool, and then only a small quantity passed; eyeballs
feel bruised and the whites have a yellowish cast all over,
though the "bands" are still very distinct; my skin is quite
yellow to-day and I feel very much fatigued generally.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 15th. Stool about natural this morning; some
feeling in my abdomen, though not so severe; no new symptoms.</p>

<p>Sunday, July 16th. The only thing unusual which I noticed
to-day was the passage of considerable offensive flatus; a
greater quantity after retiring than during the day.</p>

<p>I noticed no more symptoms after Sunday night.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following is from a letter of Dr. E. M. Hale):</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Some time ago I received a letter from Dr. F. S. Smith, of
Lock Haven, Pa., in which, referring to <i>Chionanthus</i>, he says:</p>

<p>"For the first time to-day I read your article on <i>Chionanthus</i>
in the last edition of your Materia Medica of 'New
Remedies.' I have been using this drug for over two years,
as a specific for so-called sick headache. It has done wonders
for me in that disease. I had been a victim from early childhood,
and have suffered terribly. I have not had an attack
for two years. If I am threatened, a few drops, timely taken,
dissipates it at once.</p>

<p>"Dr. B., a dentist, aged 35, dark complexion, a victim to
sick headache, had an attack on an average once in three
weeks. Since taking <i>Chionanthus</i>, has not had more than
two or three attacks in over two years, and then owing to a
neglect to take the medicine. I have failed in but one case,
and that was a menstrual sick headache.</p>

<p>"I prescribe it as follows: In cases of habitual sick headache,
5 gtts. of the 2x dil. three times a day for a week, then
twice a day for a week, then once a day for a week, after
which the patient only takes it when symptoms of the attack
show themselves. I regard it almost a specific."</p>

either acute or chronic, and the proving seems to justify the belief.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Wednesday, May 13, 1896.&mdash;Awoke this morning after a
very refreshing night's sleep, feeling as well as usual; and
did not notice anything out of the ordinary during the entire
day. Had stool, but somewhat scanty. Appetite fair.</p>

<p>Thursday, May 14, 1896.&mdash;Did not rest very well during
night. Had dream I was spending summer in country. Did
not get into anything like a sound sleep until near morning;
and then was very reluctant about getting up; would have
preferred to have had a couple hours more of such sleep. I
have noticed nothing in the course of the day worthy of
mention excepting a pain across the small of the back, which
lasted only a short time and then disappeared. Stool to-day
little better than yesterday.</p>

<p>Friday, May 15, 1896.&mdash;Another restless night; would get
into a light sleep off and on until near morning. Dreamed
again; this time of an exciting fire drill. Up to to-day had
been taking <i>Cornus alternifolia</i> thrice daily; 3 drops 30th,
commencing with this morning every three hours. Stool
to-day at first hard and difficult, then loose. Nothing further
noticed to-day.</p>

<p>Saturday, May 16, 1896.&mdash;Passed a very restless and sleepless
night; guess I was awake at the striking of every hour.
Tongue has been coated a yellowish white for a couple of
days. Stool to-day, but scanty. Feel as well as usual, but
don't seem to have the ambition to do anything for any length
of time.</p>

<p>Sunday, May 17, 1896.&mdash;Experienced another very restless
and sleepless night. Felt an aching in left shoulder and dull
pain across forehead, more particularly on right side. Stool
to-day and appetite fair.</p>

<p>Monday, May 18, 1896.&mdash;While I passed another restless
night, it was not as bad as nights previous. Seem to hear
every little noise and sound. When once awake, mind becomes
active and then it is difficult to get into a sleep again.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>
Have dreamed something mostly every night; some of which
I do not remember.</p>

<p>Tuesday, May 19, 1896.&mdash;Rested somewhat better last
night; though was awake off and on. Last dose taken at
bedtime.</p>

<p>Wednesday, May 20, 1896.&mdash;Experienced another restless
night; was awake most of the night until about 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, when
I dropped off into a sleep.</p>

<p>Friday, May 22, 1896.&mdash;Noticed a little sore inside of mouth
(left side), which by Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday
had become very annoying. When eating anything that
came in contact with it, or even when moving the mouth in
a certain direction would cause a sticking, pricking pain. I
also want to mention a few eruptions, small pustules on face
and neck, which appeared during this proving.</p>

second day had two loose evacuations in quick succession in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>February 9, 1896.&mdash;A cold feeling in chest as if it were
filled with cold air or ice; this continued for two days and
was very disagreeable, but seemed to have no influence on
action of heart or respiration.</p>

greater part of the night feeling as usual. Felt dull pain in
right side region of liver about 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span></p>

<p>Tuesday, June 9, 1896.&mdash;Slept very little; tossed and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>

No stool to-day and appetite fair.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 10, 1896.&mdash;While I rested somewhat
better than nights previous, yet was awake considerable part
of the night. Had two dreams; one of dead rats mashed to
a pulp; the other of coition, causing an emission. When I
awoke this morning, felt a raw feeling in throat, which continued
throughout the day; though not quite as bad as when
I arose. Sneezed some, too, to-day; head partially stopped
up toward night. About an hour or two after dinner, which
I ate with a relish, a sick sensation came over me, a dull
heavy feeling in forehead accompanied with a nauseous and
dizzy feeling; could hardly pull one foot after the other on
my way home from work; but after being a little while in
the open air and walking, feeling subsided some, and when I
reached home felt much better; and after supper had entirely
left me; though when I retired that night I felt as though I
had been doing a very hard day's work and was glad when
my body touched the bed. Stool very scanty to-day; appears
difficult to do anything; seems to be quite some gas.</p>

<p>Thursday, June 11, 1896.&mdash;Awoke very tired; sleep disturbed
considerably; could not rest in any position. Raw
feeling in throat still this morning, with a frequent desire to
clear; a feeling as though something lodged there and should
come out. Stool to-day, but scant. A dull ache in region of
heart felt in afternoon. Feel tired and drowsy. All ambition
seems to have left me. Appetite very good to-day.</p>

<p>Friday, June 12, 1896.&mdash;Feel very well this morning and
slept fairly well during the night, though was awake a few
times. To-day marks the first appearance of eruptions; one
on the right wrist, the other on right side of chin; small
pustules; in one case blind, all others forming pus.</p>

<p>Saturday, June 13, 1896.&mdash;Experienced another restless
night. Another pustule has appeared on chin and also ringworm
on forehead (right side); feel very well to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Sunday, June 14, 1896.&mdash;Slept fairly well during night.
Experienced nothing particular excepting toward night an
awful uneasy feeling came over me; a feeling that something
terrible was going to happen.</p>

<p>Monday, June 16, 1896.&mdash;Awoke very tired this morning;
have a cough, with a feeling as though something heavy was
lying upon my chest and throat.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 17, 1896.&mdash;Slept pretty well during
night; feel very languid and tired; a feeling as though my
legs were unable to bear me up.</p>

<p>Sunday, June 28, 1896.&mdash;Toward evening felt very tired
and drowsy with heavy sensation in head; about 9:30 lay
down upon the lounge and dropped off into a doze; awoke a
half hour afterwards with a feeling as though I wanted to
vomit, and chills, which continued for an hour when I vomited,
which seemed to relieve me some, after which fever took the
place of the chill which abated some toward morning.</p>

<p>Monday, June 29, 1896.&mdash;Managed to get to my business,
but was unable to do anything all day on account of the weak
feeling and a violent pressing headache in forehead, which
continued all day; worse on motion and on stooping felt as
though everything would come out. About 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> diarrh&#339;a
set in which continued all night, every half hour to an hour,
the same the day following and continued right up to Sunday
night, July 5th. Lost in that time six pounds.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The <i>The New York Medical Journal</i>, October 10, 1896, published a communication
from Dr. M. C. Jennings, under the heading "Cratægus Oxyacantha
in the treatment of Heart Disease," of which the following is the
substance):</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>Dr. Green, of Ennis, Ireland, for many years had a reputation
for the cure of heart disease that caused patients to flock
to him from all parts of the United Kingdom. He cured the
most of them and amassed considerable wealth by means of
his secret, for, contrary to the code, he, though a physician in
good standing, refused to reveal the remedy to his professional
brethren. After his death, about two years ago, his daughter,
a Mrs. Graham, revealed the name of the remedy her father
had used so successfully. It is <i>Cratægus oxyacantha</i>. So
much for the history of the remedy. Dr. Jennings procured
for himself some of the remedy, and his experience with it
explains Dr. Green's national reputation. He writes:</p>

<p>"Case I was that of a Mr. B., aged seventy-three years. I
found him gasping for breath when I entered the room, with
a pulse-rate of 158 and very feeble; great &#339;dema of lower
limbs and abdomen. A more desperate case could hardly be
found. I gave him fifteen drops of <i>Cratægus</i> in half a wineglass
of water. In fifteen minutes the pulse beat was 126 and
stronger, and breathing was not so labored. In twenty-five
minutes pulse beat 110 and the force was still increasing,
breathing much easier. He now got ten drops in same
quantity of water, and in one hour from the time I entered
the house he was, for the first time in ten days, able to lie
horizontally on the bed. I made an examination of the heart
and found mitral regurgitation from valvular deficiency, with
great enlargement. For the &#339;dema I prescribed <i>Hydrargyrum
cum creta</i>, <i>Squill</i> and <i>Digitalis</i>. He received ten drops
four times a day of the <i>Cratægus</i> and was permitted to use
some light beer, to which he had become accustomed at meal
time. He made a rapid and apparently full recovery until,
in three months, he felt as well as any man of his age in
Chicago. He occasionally, particularly in the change of
weather, takes some of the <i>Cratægus</i> which, he says, quickly
stops shortness of breath or pain in the heart. His father and
a brother died of heart disease."</p>

<p>Another case was that of a young woman, who, when Dr.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>
Jennings appeared in response to the summons, was said to be
dead. "I went in and found that she was not quite dead,
though apparently so. I put five or six drops of <i>Nitrite of
amyl</i> to her nose, and alternately pressing and relaxing the
chest, so as to imitate natural breathing, I soon had her able
to open her eyes and speak. I gave her hypodermically ten
drops, and in less than half an hour she was able to talk and
describe her feelings. An examination revealed a painfully
anæmic condition of the patient, but without any discoverable
lesions of the heart, except functional." Under <i>Cratægus</i>
she made a good recovery. "Her heart trouble, though very
dangerous, was only functional, and resulted from want of
proper assimilation of the food, due chiefly to the dyspeptic
state and dysentery."</p>

<p>Another case was that of a woman who "was suffering
from compensatory enlargement of the heart from mitral insufficiency,"
was taken with dyspn&#339;a when Dr. Jennings was
called and was nearly dead. Under <i>Cratægus</i> and some other
indicated remedies she made an excellent recovery. "In a
letter from her, three months afterward, she said she was feeling
well, but that she would not feel fully secure without
some of the <i>Cratægus</i>."</p>

<p>"The forty other cases ran courses somewhat similar to the
three cited&mdash;all having been apparently cured. Yet I am not
satisfied beyond a doubt, that any of those patients were completely
cured except those whose trouble of the heart were
functional, like the second case cited. And it is possible and
even probable that in weather of a heavy atmosphere or when
it is surcharged with electricity, or if the patient be subjected
to great excitement or sudden or violent commotion or exercise
he may suffer again therewith. That the medicine has
a remarkable influence on the diseased heart must, I think,
be admitted. From experiments on dogs and cats made by
myself, it appears to influence the vagi and cardio inhibitory
centres, and diminishes the pulse rate, increases the intraventricular
pressure, and thus filling the heart with blood causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
retardation of the beat and an equilibrium between the general
blood pressure and force of the beat. Cardiac impulse,
after a few days' use of the <i>Cratægus</i>, is greatly strengthened
and yields that low, soft tone so characteristic of the first
sound, as shown by the cardiograph. The entire central
nervous system seems to be influenced favorably by its use;
the appetite increases and assimilation and nutrition improve,
showing an influence over the sympathetic and the solar
plexus. Also a sense of quietude and well-being rests on the
patient, and he who before its use was cross, melancholic and
irritable, after a few days of its use shows marked signs of
improvement in his mental state. I doubt if it is indicated
in fatty enlargement. The dose which I have found to be
the most available is from ten to fifteen drops after meals or
food. If taken before food it may, in very susceptible patients,
cause nausea. I find also that after its use for a month it may
be well to discontinue for a week or two, when it should be
renewed for another month or so. Usually three months
seem to be the proper time for actual treatment, and after that
only at such times as a warning pain of the heart or dyspn&#339;a
may point out.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The <i>Kansas City Medical Journal</i>, 1898, contained a paper on the
remedy, by Dr. Joseph Clements, from which the following pertinent extracts
are taken):</p></blockquote>

<p>About twelve years ago I was suddenly seized with terrible
pain in the left breast; it extended over the entire region of
the heart and down the brachial plexus of the left arm as far
as the wrist. I pressed my hands over my heart and seemed
unable to move. My lips blenched, my eyes rolled in a paroxysm
of agony; the most fearful sense of impending calamity
oppressed me and I seemed to expect death, or something
worse, to fall upon and overwhelm me. The attack lasted a
short time and then began to subside, and soon I was myself
again, but feeling weak and excited. I consulted no one;
took no medicine. I did not know what to make of it, but
gradually it faded from my mind and I thought no more of it<span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span>
until two years afterwards, when I had another attack, and
again nearly a year later. Each of these was very severe,
like the first, and lasted about as long and left me in about
the same condition. I remember no other seizure of importance
until about three years ago, and again a year later.
These were not so terrible in the suffering involved, but the
fear, the apprehension, the awful sense of coming calamity, I
think, grew upon me. From this time on, two years ago,
the attacks came frequently, the time varying from two or
three months to two or three weeks between.</p>

<p>I took some nitro-glycerine tablets and some pills of <i>Cactus
Mexicana</i>, but with no benefit that I could perceive. This
brings me down to about fifteen months ago. I was feeling
very badly, having had several attacks within a few weeks.
My pulse was at times very rapid and weak, and irregular
and intermittent.</p>

<blockquote><p>(About this time he got hold of <i>Cratægus</i> with the following result):</p></blockquote>

<p>After getting my supply I began with six drops, increasing
to ten before meals and at bedtime. The results were marvellous.
In twenty-four hours my pulse showed marked improvement;
in two or three weeks it became regular and smooth
and forceful. Palpitation and dyspn&#339;a soon entirely left me;
I began to walk up and down hills without difficulty, and a
more general and buoyant sense of security and well-being
has come to stay. During the three months that I was taking
the medicine, which I did with a week's intermission
several times, I had several slight attacks, one rather hard
seizure, but was relieved at once on taking ten drops of the
medicine.</p>

<blockquote><p>(He adds that hypodermic of <i>Morphia</i> does not give relief from these
heart pains as quickly and as surely as does fifteen drops of <i>Cratægus</i>. He
also says, "of course I consider it the most useful discovery of the Nineteenth
century." He also names a number of "the most reputable and
careful men in the profession," who are having good results with this
remedy.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. T. C. Duncan contributes the following illustrative cases):</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. A., a printer, came to me complaining of some pain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the side as if it would take her life. She did not have it all
the time, only at times, usually the last of the week, when
tired. I prescribed <i>Bryonia</i>, then <i>Belladonna</i>, without prompt
relief. One Saturday she came with a severe attack, locating
the pain with her right hand above and to the left of the
stomach. The pulse was strong and forcible. On careful
examination I found the heart beat below the normal, indicating
hypertrophy. I examined the spine, and to the left of
the vertebra about two inches I found a very tender spot
(spinal hyperæmia). She told me that when a girl she had
several attacks, and that her own family physician (Dr.
Patchen) gave her a remedy that relieved her at once. She
had tried several physicians, among them an allopath, who
gave hypodermic injections of morphia, without relief. Hot
applications sometimes relieved.</p>

<p>I now recognized that I had a case of angina pectoris, and
that her early attacks were due, I thought, to carrying her
heavy brother. Now the attacks come when she becomes
tired holding her composing stick; at the same time she became
very much flurried, so much so that she had to stop
work because she was so confused.</p>

<p>I now gave her a prescription for <i>Cactus</i>, but told her I
would like to try first a new remedy, giving her <i>Cratægus</i>,
saturating some disks with the tincture (B. &amp; T.). I directed
her to take two disks every hour until relieved, and then less
often. If not relieved to take the <i>Cactus</i>.</p>

<p>She returned in a week reporting that she was relieved
after the first dose of <i>Cratægus</i>. More, that hurried, flurried
feeling had not troubled her this week. Her face has a
parchment skin, and the expression of anxiety so significant
of heart disease was certainly relieved. I have not seen her
since.</p>

<p>In my proving of this drug it produced a flurried feeling
due, I thought, to the rapid action of the stimulated heart.
One prover, a nervous lady medical student, gives to-day in
her report "a feeling of quiet and calmness, mentally." This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
is a secondary effect, for it was preceded by "an unusual rush
of blood to the head with a <i>confused</i> feeling."</p>

<p>"One swallow does not make a summer," neither does one
case establish a remedy; but I think that as <i>Cactus</i> has a
clearly defined therapeutic range, so it seems that <i>Cratægus</i>
may prove a valuable addition to our meagre array of heart
remedies.</p>

<h3>CUPHEA VISCOSISSIMA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Lythraceæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Common Names</span>, Clammy cuphea. Tar-weed.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The fresh plant is pounded to a pulp and
macerated in two parts by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In 1888 Dr. A. A. Roth contributed the following concerning <i>Cuphea vis.</i>
to the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i>):</p></blockquote>


<p>Two years ago, whilst battling manfully for the life of a
child ill to death from cholera infantum, I was persuaded by
a lady friend to use red pennyroyal tea, and to my delight I
had the pleasure of seeing a marvellous change in less than
twenty-four hours. The vomiting ceased promptly and the
bowels gradually became normal. Impressed by this fact,
and also the fact that it was used very extensively in home
treatment by country people, I procured the fresh plant, and
prepared a tincture as directed in the <i>American Hom&#339;opathic
Pharmacop&#339;ia</i> under article "Hedeoma." This made a
beautiful dark-green tincture, having an aromatic odor and
slightly astringent taste. Of this I gave from five to ten
drops, according to age, every hour until relieved, and then
as often as needed, and found it act promptly and effectively.
Feeling loath to add another remedy to our already over-burdened
Materia Medica, I deferred any mention of the fact;
but now after a fair trial for two seasons I feel justified in
believing that the <i>Cuphea viscosissima</i> will prove a treasure in
the treatment of cholera infantum. Out of a large number of
cases treated I had but three square failures, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
complicated with marasmus to an alarming extent before I
began the <i>Cuphea</i>; one died and two finally recovered.
<i>Cuphea</i> does not act with equal promptness in all forms of
cholera infantum. Two classes of cases stand out prominently;
and first, those arising from acidity of milk or food;
vomiting of undigested food or curdled milk, with frequent
green, watery, acid stools, varying in number from five to
thirty per day; child fretful and feverish; can retain nothing
on the stomach; food seems to pass right through the
child. I have frequently had the mother say after twenty-four
hours' use of <i>Cuphea</i>: "Doctor, the baby is all right,"
and a very pleasant greeting it is, as we all know. A second
class is composed of cases in which the stools are decidedly
dysenteric, small, frequent, bloody, with tenesmus and great
pain; high fever, restlessness and sleeplessness. In these two
classes <i>Cuphea</i> acts promptly and generally permanently. It
contains a large percentage of tannic acid, and seems to possess
decidedly tonic properties, as children rally rapidly under
its use. It utterly failed me in ordinary forms of diarrh&#339;a,
especially in diarrh&#339;as from colds, etc.; but in the classes
mentioned I have frequently had it produce obstinate constipation
after several days' use.</p>

<h3>ECHINACEA ANGUSTIFOLIA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Compositæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Pale Purple Cone-flower.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The whole plant including the root is pounded
to a pulp and macerated in two parts by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(This rather famous drug first came to notice as "Meyers' Blood Purifier;"
the proprietor did not know the name of the drug used and sent a
whole plant to Professors King and Lloyd, of Cincinnati, who identified it as
<i>Echinacea angustifolia</i>, commonly known as "cone flower," "black
Sampson," "nigger head," etc. If we may believe all that has been printed
about it the remedy is a veritable cure-all. The following, however, is a safe
guide; it is taken from the paper by Dr. J. Willis Candee in Transactions,
1898, of the Hom&#339;opathic Medical Society of the State of New York, and
credited by Dr. Candee to Dr. J. C. Fahnstock):</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>He (Dr. Fahnstock) refers to the clinical application of
<i>Echinacea</i>, from personal experience, substantially as follows:
Cases of shifting pains in rheumatism, for which <i>Puls.</i> had
been unsuccessfully prescribed, rapidly disappeared under
<i>Echin.</i> Several cases of acne resembling that caused by <i>Bromide
of Potassium</i>, cured. "A great remedy." When boils progress
to the stage where they appear about to "point" then
stop and do not suppurate, <i>Echinacea</i> is the remedy. "In carbuncles
with similar symptoms, a bluish-red color and intense
pain, it will in a few hours make your patient grateful to
you." It is of great value in very fetid ozæna. Beneficial
in some cases of leucorrh&#339;a with discharge bright yellow, as
from a suppurating surface. Very serviceable in gangrene,
where it may be classed with <i>Rhus</i> and <i>Arsenicum</i>, perhaps
ranking between them. Has attributed to it unusually good
results in a case of tuberculous disease of hip and in an old,
well-dosed case of destructive syphilis of throat. "In suppurative
processes <i>Echin.</i> is to be thought of."</p>

<p>In typhoid fever, diphtheria and appendicitis he has failed
to substantiate the claims of other admirers of this remedy.</p>

<p>These clinical hints have been given place as naturally
following report of the proving and also because of their
coming from a closely observant hom&#339;opathist. It is unnecessary
at this time to review in detail the alleged field of
usefulness of <i>Echinacea</i>. All are familiar with the published
testimonials and indications, some of which would lead one
to think that little else is to be desired with which to combat
degenerative processes in mankind.</p>

<p>On the other hand are those, who, having tried the drug
without satisfactory results, are willing to cast it aside as
worthless. To such it may be well to make these suggestions:
1, to ascertain whether they have used a reliable preparation,
and 2, to refrain from hasty judgment until guides for prescribing,
more accurate than perchance the label on a bottle,
shall have been found and consulted.</p>

<p>My own limited experience would throw no particular light<span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>
on the subject. It has, however, served to impress me with
confidence in the remedy and its future. The gist of trustworthy
clinical findings may be stated in two words, antiseptic
and alterative.</p>

<blockquote><p>(From an article by Dr. H. W. Feller, in the <i>Eclectic Medical Journal</i>, we
quote the following generalities concerning this remedy):</p></blockquote>

<p>If any single statement were to be made concerning the
virtues of <i>Echinacea</i> it would read something like this: "A
corrector of the deprivation of the body fluids;" and even this
does not sufficiently cover the ground. Its extraordinary
powers&mdash;combining essentially that formerly included under
the terms antiseptic, antifermentative, and antizymotic&mdash;are
well shown in its power over changes produced in the fluids
of the body, whether from internal causes or from external
introductions. The changes may be manifested in a disturbed
balance of the fluids resulting in such tissue alterations as are
exhibited in boils, carbuncles, abscesses, or cellular glandular
inflammations. They may be from the introduction of serpent
or insect venom, or they may be due to such fearful poisons as
give rise to malignant diphtheria, cerebro-spinal meningitis,
or puerperal and other forms of septicæmia. Such changes,
whether they be septic or of devitalized morbid accumulations,
or alterations in the fluids themselves, appear to have
met their Richmond in <i>Echinacea</i>. "Bad blood" so called,
asthenia and adynamia, and particularly a tendency to
malignancy in acute and sub-acute disorders, seem to be special
indicators for the use of <i>Echinacea</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The <i>North American Journal of Hom&#339;opathy</i>, December, 1896, contains
a paper on the drug by Dr. Charles F. Otis, from which we quote the following):</p></blockquote>

<p>I doubt if there are many physicians here assembled, who
are general practitioners, who have not, at some period of
their professional lives, come in contact with one or both of
these diseases either in an epidemic form or isolated cases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and in instances, have met more than their match; have seen
their patients with tongue so swollen that it protruded from
the mouth; with membrane gradually extending from the
throat into the posterior nares, possibly protruding from the
nostrils, with the awful odor so characteristic; with a respiratory
sound that told you too plainly that membrane was
extending into the air passages and that the misery of your
patient would soon cease, not because of your ability to afford
relief, but because death would close the scene.</p>

<p>I need not complete the picture by mentioning the enormously
high temperature, the thread-like pulse, the cessation
of the action of the kidneys, the awful agonizing expression
of the face, and, perhaps, in your efforts, intubation had
been practiced without good results. It is in just this class
of cases that <i>Echinacea</i> is king. So reliable has been its
action in my hands that I am inclined to give a favorable
prognosis, and if I am so fortunate as to be called early
the application of the drug in question does not permit of the
symptoms just enumerated. The whole case will usually be
changed to one of a mild form followed by a quick recovery.</p>

<blockquote><p>(This from a paper by Dr. W. H. Ramey in <i>Medical Gleaner</i>):</p></blockquote>

<p>It is a specific, I think, for the condition of the system
which sets up the boil habit. I never have found a case so
bad, and I've had some very severe ones, that an ounce and a
half of <i>Echinacea</i>, taken in ten-drop doses four times a day,
would not cure. Try it in your cases of stomatitis with depraved
conditions of the system, both internally and locally.
It has done me valuable service in cases of old ulcers and
unhealthy sores, both as local and internal treatment. Then
in your typhoid cases, with the characteristic indication, it is
simply a wonderful remedy. I have seen it step in and restore
normal conditions when it seemed impossible for remedies to
act quick enough to prevent a fatal termination.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. S. J. Hogan in <i>Chicago Medical Times</i>):</p></blockquote>

<p>One other thing I would like to tell about it: I had a case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
I was treating. Among other things, the patient had on the
scalp and at the margin of the hair on the back of the head
a number of wen-like tumors; since taking <i>Echinacea</i> they
have been entirely absorbed.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. Joseph Adolphus in <i>Medical Gleaner</i>):</p></blockquote>

<p>I have seen its very beneficial action in two epidemics of
smallpox. The remedy did certainly modify the severity of
the disease, restrain suppuration, check the severity of the
symptoms, and promote convalescence. I knew of several
very desperate cases, which I think would have terminated
fatally but for the timely use of <i>Echinacea</i>. I frequently
saw cases of severe confluent type, wherein the symptoms
were of a very serious kind, high fever, delirium; some with
coma, abominably offensive odor of body and breath, urine
nearly suppressed, eruption confluent, exceedingly abundant
pus, steadily improve under <i>Echinacea</i> tea taken internally
and used locally over the entire body. One of the very
striking effects of the <i>Echinacea</i> was to abate the dreadfully
offensive odor of the body and breath and modify the acute
severity of the eruption.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following proving of <i>Echinacea</i>, conducted by Dr. J. C. Fahnestock,
of Piqua, Ohio, was read before the American Institute of Hom&#339;opathy, at
Atlantic City, 1899):</p></blockquote>

long or more. Root thick, black, very pungent to the taste,
used in popular medicine under the name of Black Sampson.
Very variable, and probably connects with <i>E. angustifolia</i>,
described as follows: Leaves, as well as the slender, simple
stem, bristly, hairy, lanceolate and linear lanceolate, attenuate
at base, three nerved, entire; involucre less imbricated and
heads often smaller; rays twelve to fifteen inches, (2) long,
rose color or red. Plains from Illinois and Wisconsin southward&mdash;June
to August. This is a brief description of the
botany of the plant under consideration.</p>

<p>Your chairman, T. L. Hazard, in his usual characteristic
manner, went vigorously to work and secured all the provers
possible. I was also fortunate enough to secure a number of
provers, besides proving and reproving it myself. The results
of all these provings were handed over to me to present to you
in such form as seemed best.</p>

<p>I must tarry just long enough to preface this collection and
tell you that explicit printed directions were sent to all the
superintendents of these provings. This being of too great
length, I will give you the most important points in these
directions, viz.: Let each prover be furnished with a small
blank book, in which shall be written date, name, sex, residence,
height, weight, temperament, color of eyes, color of
hair, complexion; describe former ailments and present
physical condition. In concluding give pulse in different
positions, respiration, temperature, function of digestion,
analysis of excretions, especially the urine; analysis of the
blood, family history, habits, idiosyncrasy, etc.</p>

<p>The different colleges and universities were called upon to
assist on these provings. The following institutions responded
to the call: Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, the
Chicago, Iowa City, and Ann Arbor. None of the eastern
institutions responded; don't know whether dead or just
hibernating.</p>

<p>I wish to publicly express my thanks to all who have<span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span>
taken part in these provings. I think it but just to state that
the University of Michigan furnished the best provings.
Thanks also are extended to Boericke &amp; Tafel for remedy
furnished in the &#952;, 3x, 30x, which were also used in the provings.
One lady, who commenced the proving and had begun
to develop valuable provings, contracted a severe cold
and stopped, for which I am very sorry. All the rest of the
provers were males; medical students or physicians. Only a
very few symptoms were produced by the use of the 30x attenuation,
a greater number of provers not recording any at
all.</p>

<p>The symptoms here compiled were produced by the 3x attenuation
and the tincture, using from one drop to thirty
drops at a dose. In proving and then compiling the symptoms
produced by this drug, I am fully aware of the many
difficulties to be met on every side.</p>

<p>The one great trouble that I find is that those who are unaccustomed
to proving do not observe what really is going on
while attempting to make a proving, and are not capable of
expressing the conditions so produced. I find that there are
few who can take drugs and accurately define their effects.
In selecting and discriminating the effects of drugs there
must exist a mental superiority, and no man had this genius
so highly developed as Hahnemann.</p>

<p>After making three different provings upon myself, I have
undertaken to select those symptoms which to the best of my
ability were found in all of these different provings.</p>

<p>I have taken special care not to omit any symptoms, even
though it may have been noticed by but one prover; but in
the majority of cases you will notice the symptoms occurred
two or more times in different individuals, thus confirming
the genuineness of the symptoms.</p>

<p>Not giving you the day-book records of these provers, a few
remarks, showing its general action, may not be out of place.
As stated before, only two recorded symptoms after the use of
the 30x attenuation.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>After taking the tincture, there is soon produced a biting,
tingling sensation of the tongue, lips and fauces, not very
much unlike the sensation produced by <i>Aconite</i>. In these
provers there soon followed a sense of fear, with pain about
the heart, and accelerated pulse. In a short time there was
noticed a dull pain in both temples, a pressing pain; then
shooting pains, which followed the fifth pair of nerves.</p>

<p>The next symptom produced was an accumulation of sticky
mucus in mouth and fauces. Then a general languor and
weakness followed, always worse in the afternoon. All the
limbs felt weak and indisposed to make any motion, and this
was accompanied by sharp, shooting, shifting pains. In quite
a number of cases the appetite was not affected.</p>

<p>Those using sufficient quantity of the tincture had loss of
appetite, with belching of tasteless gas, weakness in the
stomach, pain in the right hypochondriac region, accompanied
with gas in the bowels; griping pains followed by passing
offensive flatus, or a loose, yellowish stool, which always produced
great exhaustion. After using the drug several days
the face becomes pale, the pulse very much lessened in frequency,
and a general exhaustion follows like after a severe
and long spell of sickness.</p>

<p>The tongue will then indicate slow digestion, accompanied
with belching of tasteless gas. In most of the provers, however,
there was a passing of very offensive gas and offensive
stools.</p>

<p>You will observe that the remedy exerts quite an effect on
the kidneys and bladder, but I am very sorry to say that the
urinary analysis made did not show anything but the variations
generally observed in ordinary health.</p>

<p>I must say that the provers did not go into the details as
much as was desirable. Likewise, I may say the same of the
blood tests made, but what was given is very valuable.</p>

<p>I could give you an expression of its special action, but
will merely give you the symptoms collected and then you
can make your own deductions.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span></p>

Root.<br />

macerated in two parts by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In the subjoined paper by Dr. E. M. Hale, <i>North American Journal
of Hom&#339;opathy</i>, 1869, the old doctrine of signatures seems to crop out
again.)</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Gravel Root</i> has long had some reputation in urinary
difficulties, and even in calculous affections. The common
appellation of "Gravel root" shows that the popular belief
points in the direction of its use.</p>

<p>I have never tested its virtues but in one instance, and its
effects seemed to be so decided and curative that I deem the
case worthy of publication.</p>

<p>A young man, aged twenty-three, applied for treatment of
a long array of symptoms, some of which seemed to indicate
<i>enlargement of the prostate</i>, and others a <i>vesical catarrh</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>quantity</i> of urine was nearly normal.</p>

<p>The <i>quality</i> was decidedly abnormal. It contained a large
amount of mucus, the phosphates, some blood, and a little
pus. It was dark red, colored blue litmus paper red (showing
its acid condition).</p>

<p>The pain was similar to a vesical tenesmus, a pain in the
region of the neck of the bladder and prostate gland. Pressure
in the perineum was painful.</p>

<p>He had been under the most atrocious allopathic treatment;
had been drugged with copaiva, spts. nitric.-dulc., turpentine,
tincture muriate of iron, and other diuretics in enormous
doses.</p>

<p>I commenced the treatment with <i>Sulphur</i> 30th, three doses
a day for a week.</p>

<p>By this time he had eliminated the drug-poisons from his
system, and the real symptoms of the malady began to appear
uncomplicated. The blood and pus disappeared from the
urine, there was less mucus, and the urine was of a lighter
color.</p>

<p>A red, sandy sediment, however, remained. This sediment
was not "gritty" under the finger, at least no such sensation
was perceptible.</p>

<p>Second prescription: <i>Lycopodium</i> 30th and 6th, the former
in the morning, the latter in evening, for a week. No improvement
except a slight diminution of the sediment.</p>

<p>No medicine was given for four days, at which time there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
appeared dysuria, pain in the region of the prostate, mucous
sediment, and itching at the orifice of the urethra.</p>

<p>While undecided as to the next prescription, I happened to
take up a vial of tincture <i>Epigea repens</i>, which I had prepared
from the fresh plant, while on a visit to Mackinaw six
months before. Knowing the high estimate placed on this
plant, by the people, in the treatment of gravel I resolved to
test its virtues. Ten drops of the mother tincture were prescribed,
to be taken every four hours.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards my patient brought me several small
brownish particles, having the appearance of fine sand. When
crushed and pressed between the fingers they had a decidedly
gritty feel. Under the microscope they had the appearance
of rough coarse sand. The discharge of calculi kept up for
nearly a week, under the use of the <i>Epigea</i>, and then ceased,
and with it all the symptoms of irritation of the bladder.</p>

<p>It is just possible that the discharge of gravel may have
been a coincidence. It is equally possible that the <i>Lycopodium</i>
acted curatively; but I am inclined to believe their disintegration
and expulsion was caused or aided by the use of
the last medicine.</p>

<p>Further observations are needed to place the curative
powers of this plant on a certain basis.</p>

<p>"For spermatorrh&#339;a properly so called, or emission of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
semen without erections, there is no remedy which has yet
received the sanction of experience."&mdash;<i>Repertory.</i></p>

<p>"We have one, however, to propose for trial&mdash;it is the
<i>Eryngium aquaticum</i>, which has two remarkable cures, reported
by Dr. Parks (Pharmacentist, Cin.), to recommend it.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Case I.</span>&mdash;A married man injured his testicles by jumping
upon a horse; this was followed by a discharge of what was
considered semen for fifteen years, during which time he was
treated allopathically and hom&#339;opathically. Dr. Parks exhibited
a number of the usual remedies without permanent
benefit. He then gave a half-grain dose, three times a day, of
the third decimal trituration of the '<i>Eryngium aquaticum</i>.'
In five days the emissions were entirely suppressed, and have
not returned to this time (over two years ago). The emissions
were without erections day or night, and followed by great
lassitude.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Case II.</span>&mdash;A married man, not conscious of having sustained
any injury, was troubled for eight or ten years with
emissions at night&mdash;with erections. The semen also passed
by day with the urine. The loss of semen was followed by
great lassitude and depression, continuing from twelve to
forty-eight hours. There was also partial impotence. Had
been treated allopathically. Dr. Parks gave him Phos. acid
for two weeks, without material benefit. He then exhibited
the <i>Eryngium aquaticum</i>, as above, with the like excellent
and prompt result."<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>I used this remedy with a patient who was quite broken
down from spermatorrh&#339;a; the emissions left him, but he
suffered from vertigo and dim-sightedness whenever he took
a dose of the medicine. He is now well through the use of
other medicines. Our English <i>Eryngo</i>&mdash;the <i>E. maritimum</i>,
is noted as an aphrodisiac, and is very similar in appearance
to the <i>Eryngium aquaticum</i>.</p>

<p>Its action on the system is intense and peculiar. It is
called by the country people by the expressive name of <i>Go-quick</i>,
referring to its quick and prompt action. I am indebted
to Dr. A. R. Brown, of Litchfield, Mich., for many interesting
facts relating to its action. It is considered, by those who use
it, as the most powerful "revulsive agent" in their Materia
Medica, in all cases of local congestion, especially of the lungs
and head; also in inflammation of the pleura, lungs, and
liver, and is used as a substitute for bleeding and Calomel. Its
admirers allege that it will certainly <i>arrest</i> the progress of
the above affections in a few hours, and break up all simple
fevers. This is of course erroneous, but it reminds one of the
Helleborine of the ancients, so graphically described by
Hahnemann. In fact no drug with which I am acquainted
so much resembles the <i>Veratrum album</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following paper was published in the Transactions of the Hom&#339;opathic
Society of Maine in 1895. It is by Dr. D. C. Perkins, of Rockland,
Me.)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span>There is, perhaps, no well proven remedy in the Materia
Medica, of equal value to that of which I present a brief
study, that has been so wholly overlooked by the hom&#339;opathic
profession. There certainly is none which possesses a
more marked individuality, and which more fully fills a place
by itself. It is safe to say that not one in ten of those who
practice the healing art has ever used it or is familiar with
its pathogenesis. Having not unfrequently cured cases with
it, which had refused to yield to other remedies apparently
well indicated, I have come to regard it as among the important
drugs in our super-abundant Materia Medica. Its effects
upon mental conditions are marked by depression of spirits,
irritability, inability to study, or to remember what has been
read, bringing to our minds <i>Aconite</i>, <i>Bryonia</i>, <i>Chamomilla</i>,
<i>Coffea</i>, <i>Colocynth</i>, <i>Ignatia</i>, <i>Lachesis</i>, <i>Mercury</i>, <i>Nux vomica</i>,
<i>Staphisagria</i>, <i>Stramonium</i>, and <i>Veratrum</i>. Its effects upon
the head are deep-seated and persistent. There is vertigo,
confusion, severe pain in many parts of head, with upward
pressure described as of a bursting character. The pain may
be in forehead, back of eyes, through temporal region on
either side, but always of a pressive or bursting nature. For
congestive headaches it is as valuable as <i>Belladonna</i>, <i>Glonoine</i>,
<i>Nux vomica</i>, or <i>Sepia</i>.</p>

<p>In and about the eyes there is itching, smarting, swelling,
heat and soreness; the itching being especially marked and
usually regarded as characteristic. The last named symptom
is no less prominent in affections of the ears, as has often been
shown in the efficacy of buckwheat flour in frost-bites, or
erysipelas of those useful organs, from time immemorial.
Here the similarity to <i>Agaricus</i> will readily be recognized.
The nose does not escape. It is swollen, red, inflamed and
sore. There is at first fluent coryza with sneezing, followed
by fulness, dryness and the formation of crusts. Nor is the
burning absent which has been elsewhere noted. There is
much soreness and somewhat persistent pain from even gentle
pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span>The face is pale or unevenly flushed, with dark semi-circles
below the eyes. Later, the face becomes swollen, hot and
dry, as though severely sunburnt, and the lips are cracked
and sore. The mouth feels dry and hot, and yet saliva is not
wanting. There is soreness and swelling of roof of mouth,
and the tongue is red and fissured along its edges. The bad
taste in the morning reminds us of <i>Pulsatilla</i>.</p>

<p>In the throat, there is soreness with pain just back of the
isthmus of the fauces, a feeling of excoriation and soreness
extending deep down in the pharynx. The uvula is elongated,
the tonsils are swollen and red, there is a sensation of
rawness in the throat strikingly reminding us of <i>Phytolacca</i>.
Externally, there is scarlet redness of the neck below the
mastoid process, throbbing of the carotids, the neck feels
tired, the head heavy and the parotid glands are swollen and
painful. It is unnecessary to name the remedy having similar
symptoms.</p>

<p>While the symptoms produced on the digestive tract are
not characterized by that intensity noted elsewhere, they are
still valuable. There is persistent morning nausea which
should lead us to study this remedy in the vomiting of pregnancy.
Contrary to <i>Lycopodium</i> and <i>Nux moschata</i> the appetite
is improved by eating. The empty or "all-gone" feeling
at the stomach is like that of <i>Sepia</i>.</p>

<p>In the abdomen there is fulness and pain but no rumbling.
Discharges of flatus are frequent and annoying. The region
of the liver is painful, tender and there is aggravation from
pressure, compelling the patient to lie on the left side. The
stools are pappy, or watery, profuse, offensive and followed by
tenesmus.</p>

<p>On the male genital organs there is profuse perspiration of
an offensive odor. The urine is scalding, and pain extends
from testicles to abdomen. In females the drug acts with
force upon the right ovary, producing pain of a bruised or
burning character, noted particularly when walking. There
is pruritus with slight yellow leucorrh&#339;a, the discharge being<span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>
more noticed when at rest than when exercising. So far as
known this latter symptom does not occur under the action
of any other remedy.</p>

<p>In the chest we find a heavy, pulsating pain extending to
all its parts. This is persistent, and is worse from a deep
inspiration. Around the heart there are dull pains with
oppression and occasional sharp pains passing through the
heart. Pressure with the hand increases the oppression. The
pulse is increased but is extremely variable. There is reason
to believe that <i>Cactus grandiflora</i>, or <i>Spigelia</i> are often given
in affections of the heart, where <i>Fagopyrum</i>, if given, would
accomplish better results.</p>

<p>On the muscular system the action of the remedy stands
out in bold relief. There is stiffness and soreness of all the
muscles of the neck, with pain, and a feeling as if the neck
would hardly support the head. Pains extend from occiput
to back of neck and are relieved by bending the head backward.
There are dull pains in small of back, with stitching
pains in the region of the kidneys. Pains with occasional
sharp stitches extend from the arms to muscles of both sides
of chest. Rheumatic pains in the shoulders of a dull aching
character. Stinging and burning pains extend the whole
length of fingers, aggravated by motion. Streaking pains
pass through arms and legs with sharp pains extending to
feet. Pains extend from hips to small of back, and these also
frequently run down to the feet. In the knees there is dull
pain and weakness, while deep in the limbs there is burning
and stinging. There is numbness in the limbs, with dragging
in the joints, especially right knee, hip and elbow.
Stooping to write causes constant severe pain through chest
and in region of liver. This group of symptoms gives <i>Fagopyrum</i>
a striking individuality and establishes it in an uncontested
position among the long list of remedies prescribed for
rheumatic complaints.</p>

<p>Scarcely less important are the symptoms of the skin.
There is intense itching of the arms and legs, becoming worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
toward evening. Blotches like flea-bites appear in many
localities, sometimes all over the body, are sore to the touch
and are multiplied by scratching. These eruptions are persistent
and the itching is intense. Blind boils may be developed
and attain a large size. The itching of the face is
especially marked about the roots of the whiskers. Itching
of the hands which is "deep in" is persistent and annoying,
this condition being supposed to be the result of irritation of
the coats of the arteries.</p>

<p>The sleepiness is unlike that of <i>Belladonna</i>, <i>Nux vomica</i>,
<i>Sepia</i> or <i>Sulphur</i>, occurring early in the evening and characterized
by stretching and yawning. It is not profound,
and when the mind is diverted the patient gets wide awake,
but soon relapses unless conversation is continued. In bed,
sleep is disturbed by troublesome dreams and frequent waking.
Aggravations occur after retiring, ascending stairs,
from deep inspiration, walking in bright sunlight, lying on
right side, riding in cars, and when stooping or writing.
Ameliorations occur after taking coffee, from cold applications,
from motion in cold air, and from sitting still in warm
room.</p>

Christian Frederick Seleg, M. D., of Enbenstoff, in Saxony,
printed in Eslong, in 1762.</p>

<p>A boy aged 13 had eaten four days ago a large quantity of
beech nuts. I found him in great pain, languid, and terrified
with apprehensions of present death. Pulse very unequal,
sometimes extremely quick, sometimes languid and intermittent;
skin burning violently; mouth flowing with froth and
saliva, intolerable thirst, entreating for drink, but as soon as
any liquid was brought he seemed to shudder with equal horror,
as if he had been eating unripe grapes. Soon after eating
the nuts he had been seized with torpor, gloominess and
dread of liquids. He had not been bitten by any rabid
animal.</p>

<p>Next (5th) day, early in the morning, he was the same, but
seemed to talk more in his wildness and perturbation of mind,
and his mouth flowed with foam more abundantly; the
urine he had voided by night was red and firey, depositing a
copious turbid white sediment, resembling an emulsion of
beech nuts, subsiding as deep as the breadth of the finger at
the bottom of the vessel. A few hours before he died he
vomited a porraceous bile, after which he died quietly.</p>

<p>The author in the <i>original</i> work gives a number of fatal
cases of <i>spontaneous</i> hydrophobia. This work should be examined.</p>

<p>John Bauhin (<i>Hist. Plants</i>, vol. i, pp. 2, 121) says that the
nuts will disorder the head like darnel; hogs grow stupid and
drowsy by feeding on them.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In the <i>Union Médicale</i>, November, 1852, two French physicians detailed
several cases of gout and rheumatism treated with <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>, or
ash leaves, one of Rademacher's favorite remedies. Of the two physicians,
one of them, Dr. Peyraud, was himself relieved of the gout by this treatment.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Ash-leaves were highly recommended by Rademacher, and
have been quite extensively used in Germany on his suggestion.
In the <i>Union Médicale</i> for Nov. 27, 1852, two French
physicians, Drs. Pouget and Peyraud, detailed several cases of
gout and rheumatism cured by an infusion of ash-leaves in
boiling water. Dr. Peyraud himself was one of those relieved.</p>

<p>"In 1842, Dr. Peyraud had his first attack of gout, which
was severe, and lasted for twenty-five days. During the three
following years the attacks increased in frequency and
severity. Having derived little benefit from the remedial
means which he had resorted to, he listened to the suggestion
of one of his patients, an inhabitant of the department of
Dordogne, in France, who advised him to try an infusion of
ash-leaves, informing him, at the same time, that his forefathers
had been cured by this prescription, and that many of
the country people got rid of 'their pains' by employing it.
Dr. Peyraud took the infusion of ash-leaves and from 1845 to
1849 had no fit of gout. He then had an attack, which
yielded in five days to the infusion of ash-leaves, used
under the observation of Dr. Pouget. These circumstances
recalled to the recollection of Dr. Pouget a fact which he
might otherwise never again have considered. It was this:
that when he was a physician at Soréze, in 1824, the peasants
of that place had spoken to him of the great power which an
infusion of ash-leaves had in driving away pains. He afterwards
discovered that it had been used forty years ago as a
gout-specific by the peasants of Auvergne.</p>

<p>"A commercial traveller, who had been gouty for twenty
years, and had saturated himself with the syrup of Boubée and
other vaunted specifics, consulted Dr. Pouget. At this time
he was an almost constant prisoner in his room with succes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>sive
attacks. After eleven days' use of the infusion, he was
able to walk two kilomètres (one and a quarter English miles);
in fifteen days he resumed his journeys, and was able to
travel without suffering, by diligence, from Bordeaux to
Quimper.</p>

<p>"Several other cases are detailed, some of them acute, and
others chronic. Articular rheumatism, in numerous instances,
was also benefited by the infusion of ash-leaves."</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following letter, by Dr. J. Herbert Knapp to the <i>Hom&#339;opathic
Recorder</i>, was published in 1896):</p></blockquote>

<p>After treating many cases of exophthalmic goitre, I have
come to the conclusion that I have found a specific for that
disease in <i>Fucus vesiculosis</i> (sea-wrack). I might record one
case. Mrs. Mary B., æt. 24 years, German, came into my
clinic at the Brooklyn E. D. Hom&#339;opathic Dispensary to
be treated for swelling of the neck of several years' duration.
I gave her the tincture of <i>Fucus ves.</i>, thirty drops three times
a day. The treatment began December 1, 1895, and patient
was discharged cured, on October 2, 1896. Would be pleased
to hear from any others who have had any experience with
<i>Fucus vesiculosis</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The foregoing brought out this by Dr. R. N. Foster, of Chicago):</p></blockquote>

<p>It gives me great pleasure to be able to say a word confirmatory
of the remarks made in your December issue by<span class="pagenum">[Pg 141]</span>
J. Herbert Knapp, M. D., respecting the above named drug.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, while turning over the pages of that
very useful book, "The American Eclectic Dispensatory," by
John King, M. D., I chanced to notice the following sentences:
"<i>Fucus vesiculosis</i>, sea-wrack, or bladder-wrack,...
has a peculiar odor, and a nauseous saline taste....
The charcoal of this plant has long had the reputation of a
deobstruent, and been given in goitre and scrofulous swelling."</p>

<p>So far as I now remember, this is the only hint I ever received
which led me to try the drug in goitre. At the same
time, I do not feel sure of this. Perhaps I had met in some
medical journal a statement respecting the relation of this
drug to goitre, which fact led me to look it up in the "Eclectic
Dispensatory." But if so, I cannot recall the authority.
At all events, I was led to try the remedy in a pronounced
case of goitre, with such good results that I have never since
given any other remedy for that disease, either in the exophthalmic
or in the uncomplicated form. And what is more, I
have never known it to fail to cure when the patient was
under thirty years of age. After that time of life, or about
that period, it seems to be no longer efficacious.</p>

<p>I have now used it on more than twenty-four cases, with
the same unvarying result, and never with any other result&mdash;that
is, no unpleasant consequences have ever accompanied or
followed its use.</p>

<p>I published this fact in the <i>Medical Investigator</i> after I had
used it in a few cases, and again announced it in the Chicago
Hom&#339;opathic Medical Society still later; and again have frequently
repeated it with growing confidence and of greater
numbers of cases in medical societies, in colleges, and in
private conversation with physicians.</p>

<p>And yet the fact is so utterly unknown that your journal
publishes Dr. Knapp's inquiry respecting it, which shows
how easily a good thing may be forgotten, and how readily a
genuine specific may be superseded by a host of abortive pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>cedures
right under the eyes of the profession. It is most
probable that more real good things have been forgotten or
cast aside in medicine than it now, or at any one time,
possesses.</p>

<p>Respecting this <i>Fucus vesiculosis</i> and its use in goitre, I
would like to add a few words. The drug is of variable
quality. If one specimen fails to give satisfaction it ought to
be discarded and another tried. The pharmacist must be importuned
to make special efforts to give us an article that is
not inert, but contains all the activity that belongs to the
drug.</p>

<p>Time is required for effecting a cure. This varies according
to the age and size of the goitre. Three months may
suffice for a small goitre of one year's growth. Six months
may be required for one twice as large and of longer standing.
A year and a half is the longest period during which I
have had to continue the medicine. But during all that time
the goitre was manifestly diminishing.</p>

<p>The dose is a teaspoonful of the tincture twice or three
times daily, in a well-developed case. Half a teaspoonful
twice a day will answer in recent cases.</p>

<p>Smaller doses seem not to produce any effect.</p>

<p>The medicine is very unpleasant to the taste, but causes no
disturbance after it has been taken. It ought to be taken,
each dose in about two ounces of water, and preferably between
meals.</p>

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The distilled oil from the leaves of Gaultheria

<blockquote><p>(These two papers were contributed to the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i>, 1894,
by Dr. Benj. F. Lang, York, Nebraska, on the action of <i>Gaultheria</i>.)</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>My attention was first called to its use about ten years ago
in southern Ohio, where I received most pleasing results in
the treatment of inflammatory rheumatism. Afterwards to a
somewhat more disagreeable class of complaints in form of
neuralgia. While I am not a champion of any specific, I
want to say that this drug has given me the quickest and
most satisfactory results of any remedy in the Materia Medica.
If there is anything that a man wants relief from quick and
"now," it is from these excruciating pains. Often was I
called to treat some obstinate cases of ciliary neuralgia, or
facial, or in fact nearly every form of neuralgia, and found my
skill taxed to its utmost to bring out the balm. Did I find it
in the hom&#339;opathic indicated remedy? I trust so, but not in
any Materia Medica. I don't say but what I got some results
from them, but I found it in this a "helper;" it came to my
relief immediately and to the great comfort of the patient. In
severest cases of neuralgias of the head and face it would do
its work quick and well. Equally well has it served me in
very severe cases of neuralgia of stomach and bowels, while
for the past few years it has done faithful work in ovarian
and uterine neuralgias following or preceding difficult menstruation.
I have many a dear friend to-day whose relief from
suffering was found in this remedy.</p>

<p>I am satisfied that it should be given a prominent place in
our Materia Medica. Lest this article should become tedious,
I will cite a few cases.</p>

<p>Mr. A., travelling man from Chicago, a few years ago called
on me for temporary relief of a severe case of ciliary neuralgia;
said he had suffered for many years with it, every spring
especially, and that he had consulted great numbers of physicians
of Chicago, Milwaukee and Cincinnati, and, as he said,
"had taken bushels of drugs, both old and new school," with
only temporary relief. So he expected nothing more, as he
was told he must wear it out. I told him I thought I could
give him relief. I furnished him one-half ounce of <i>Gaultheria</i>,
with directions to take; did not see him again for two years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
when he came into my office one day and greeted me by saying
I was the only man that could ever give him any permanent
relief from his sufferings; that he never had any return after
first day taking medicine, and unlike most patrons wanted to
make me a present of a $5 (five dollar bill), which of course
no doctor refuses. I cite this first, as it was of long standing
and had tested the ability of a number of prominent men.</p>

<p>Miss B., dressmaker, came to me suffering terribly with
facial neuralgia and greeted me similar to No. 1; that she
expected nothing but temporary relief, as she had been afflicted
for a long time. Gave her two (2) drachms of oil W.; told
her to take one dose immediately and another in two hours if
the pain did not quiet down. She was careful to ask if it was
an opiate, as she objected to that. I assured her it was not;
saw her next day, said that pain disappeared and had not returned.
I was acquainted with the lady for three and one-half
years, and she only had one return of the disease, which
the same remedy relieved immediately. Many cases more
could I cite in which it never has failed me.</p>

<p>Mrs. G., No. 3. I was called to relieve a severe case of
neuralgia of stomach and bowels this last summer, who had
been under the care of two of my worthy competitors. They
had exhausted their pill case, and for about three weeks the
poor woman had suffered everything but death itself. After
diagnosing the case I put her on this remedy, and in two
hours she was relieved and after two days was able to be
about, and was cured shortly by no other remedy than it. I
want to say you will find a true friend in this remedy in all
forms of neuralgia, and only give a few suggestions now; but
if it should be necessary could give scores to prove its value.</p>

<p>I mentioned in the beginning that it had been of great
value in inflammatory rheumatism. So it has, and will give
later many cases of immediate and permanent relief if it would
be of any value to the profession. A word as to the best way
of giving the drug. I have found that the dose should never
be less than five drops, and if pain is severe fifteen drops re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>peated
in half hour; afterward two hours apart. For adult it
may be necessary to give twenty drops at first. It always
should be dropped on sugar and taken.</p>

<p>One suggestion: I would like to have it put in a tablet of
about two to five drops pure oil, as I think it could be taken
more satisfactorily. While the crude oil is very pleasant to
take at first, yet, on account of its strong odor, will nauseate
after awhile if not removed from room. I am confident that
if you make this into a tablet and place it among your remedies
you would have a weapon that you could place into the
hands of doctors of untold value in these troubles.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The latter part of the foregoing communication was addressed to Messrs.
Boericke &amp; Tafel, hom&#339;opathic pharmacists. This was followed by a second
communication reading as follows):</p></blockquote>

<p>Since the few lines written for the last issue of <i>Recorder</i>
on <i>Gaultheria</i> in treatment of neuralgia, I have been asked
to write my experience with it in inflammatory rheumatism.</p>

<p>It has never failed me in this terrible disease to give relief.
My experience with it dates back to the fall of 1884, in Ross
county, Ohio, where I was called to treat a very stubborn case,
then under the treatment of one of my old school friends. The
patient, a lady about fifty years old, had suffered with two
previous attacks, lasting about three months each time. At
the time I was called to treat her she had been confined to
bed about four weeks. She was suffering intensely, the joints
of upper and lower limbs being swollen and extremely tender;
in fact, so sensitive that one could scarcely walk about the
bed without causing great suffering; temperature, 103; pulse
weak and intermittent. At my first visit, 2:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, I ordered
all of the joints to be wrapped with cotton, to exclude all air.
I then gave her <i>Bry.</i> On my return, next day, I did not find
much improvement, excepting the nausea, which was due to
heroic drugging she had been subjected to. Continued <i>Bry.</i>
The next day the appetite some better, but joints still very
tender; temperature and pulse about the same; some diffi<span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>culty
in respiration. I then resolved to try <i>Gaultheria</i>. I
left one drachm vial of the remedy and ordered the same to
be divided into two equal doses, one-half at one o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
the balance at five o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>At about 7:30 of the same evening a messenger came into
town in great haste, saying my patient was failing very fast,
and requested me to come out as soon as possible. On my
arrival at the home I found the patient sitting by the fire.
The husband informed me that he thought she was losing her
mind. I asked her why she was out of bed; she said she saw
no reason for staying in bed after a patient was well, and
further said that about one hour after taking the first dose she
began to move easily, and after taking second dose all of the
soreness and swelling left the joints. She also said she was
all right; that we need not feel alarmed about her. I made
only one visit after; continued the same remedy; there were
no relapses.</p>

<p>No. 2. A prominent woman in Nebraska had been under
treatment for ten days with free old-line medication, Dover's
powders and <i>Morphia</i> as palliatives. Husband consulted me
to know whether anything could be given to relieve her suffering.
I called and found her with temperature 102, pulse
105, left (hand) fingers and elbow joints swollen, very sensitive
to touch or movement. I at once assured her that I
thought she would get relief without any more <i>Morphia</i>.
Gave her one-half drachm <i>Gaultheria</i> and requested her to
take twenty drops in two hours if pain and soreness was not
relieved. This was about 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I met her husband next
morning on street on my way to visit her again and he said
"that he hardly thought it necessary, as his wife was relieved
in about one hour after taking first dose and felt no pain after
second, and that she was up dressing her hair when he left
home." She had a slight return on account of overwork, but
remedy always gave relief and made firm patrons of one of
our best families for me. I always advise patients to wrap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the joints with cotton to exclude air and advise them to
keep quiet.</p>

<p>No. 3. Young man, twenty-eight; had two attacks before,
one lasting three months, the second ten weeks. This was the
worst case that I have ever treated. As the heart was very
weak, pulse intermittent, I put him on the remedy, <i>Gaultheria</i>,
with almost immediate relief, but second day there
was relapse, which again responded immediately to treatment
by same remedy; with this, or in connection with this remedy,
I used some <i>Bry.</i> 3 and <i>Rhus tox.</i> 3. I dismissed him in ten
days, more than pleased, as we were always able to control
the pain immediately without any other remedy than <i>Gaultheria</i>.</p>

<p>I cite these cases among the many that I have had, and
have never failed to get good results in any; will say that I
give any other remedy after soreness and swelling are removed
that may be indicated, always taking the necessary precaution
to exclude all air from parts affected and to keep them warm.
About three hours apart is as often as I give remedy, and
always careful to give it on sugar and remove it from room,
with <i>spoon used</i>.</p>

<p>No. 4. Since my article on neuralgia I had a quite severe
case of sciatica that had taxed the skill of one of my worthy
competitors for nearly two months without any good results;
he was about to go to Hot Springs for some relief. Meeting
me on the street, wanted to know if I thought any of my
"little pills or drops would give any relief." I assured him
that I was quite positive that I could. He could hardly move
about, and suffered very much if he did; he came and got a
prescription and found relief to his great astonishment almost
immediately; has had it refilled twice and has worked every
day; he takes the remedy morning and night; there is no
pain or soreness, nor has there been any after first day, only if
he sneezes or gets the leg cramped there seems to be slight
contraction of nerve, but the remedy has done most satisfactory
work in this case and gained a valuable family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>I hope these few cases may be of some benefit to the readers
of the <i>Recorder</i>: 1. Be careful to observe the rule that if
remedy should nauseate cease giving for twelve or twenty-four
hours. 2. Always give on sugar or in tablets. 3. Remove
it immediately from room after administering. 4.
Cover joints to exclude air and keep them warm. 5. Give
any other indicated remedy.</p>

<h3>HELODERMA HORRIDUS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The virus, obtained by irritating the animal
and allowing it to bite on glass, is triturated in the usual way.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. T. L. Bradford furnishes us with the following classification of this
reptile):</p></blockquote>

<p>The heloderma is classed as follows: Order: Saurii. Lacertilia.
Lizards. Sub order: 5. Fissilinguia. Family: Lacratidæ.
Heloderma horridum of Mexico; the crust lizard; the
Mexican Caltetopen. Called heloderma from its skin being
studded with nail or tubercle-like heads. The Gila monster
is a native of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. It is smaller
than the Mexican variety, and is called, by Cope, Heloderma
Suspectum. It is the only lizard whose character is not
above reproach, hence the name. Zoology says: An esquamate-tongued
lizard with clavicles not dilated proximally, a
postorbital arch, no postfront-osquamosal arch, the pre and
post frontals in contact, separating the frontal from the orbit,
and furrowed teeth receiving the different ducts of highly
developed salivary glands.</p>

<blockquote><p>(There has been considerable difference of opinion as to whether the
Heloderma is poisonous or not; but the following abstract from a paper on
the subject read before the College of Physicians, Philadelphia, 1883, by S.
Wier Mitchell, together with the provings made later, ought to very effectually
settle all dispute on this point; the conclusions are the result of experiments
on animals):</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 149]</span>The poison of heloderma causes no local injury. It arrests
the heart in diastole, the organ afterwards contracts slowly&mdash;possibly
in rapid rigor mortis.</p>

<p>The cardiac muscle loses its irritability to stimuli at the
time it ceases to beat. The other muscles and nerves respond
to irritants.</p>

<p>The spinal cord has its power annihilated abruptly, and refuses
to respond to the most powerful electrical currents.</p>

<p>This virulent heart poison contrasts strongly with serpent
venom, since they give rise to local hæmorrhages, causing
death chiefly through failure of respiration and not by the
heart unless given in overwhelming doses. They lower
muscle and nerve reactions, especially those of the respiratory
apparatus, but do not cause extreme and abrupt loss of spinal
power. They also produce secondary pathological appearances
absent in heloderma poisoning.</p>

<p>The briefest examination of the lizard's anatomy makes it
clear why it has been with reason suspected to be poisonous,
and why it poisons with so much difficulty. Unless the
teeth are entire, the poison abundant, and the teeth buried in
the bitten flesh so as to force it down into contact with the
ducts where they open at the crown of the teeth, it is hard to
see how even a drop of poison could be forced into the wounds.
Yet it is certain that small animals may die from the bite, and
this may be due to the extraordinary activity of the poison,
and to the lizard's habit of holding tenaciously to what it
bites, so as to allow time for a certain amount of absorption.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The provings and the clinical cases that follow were from the virus of the
Gila monster obtained by Dr. Charles D. Belden, of Ph&#339;nix, Arizona, in
1890, who suggested it as a possible remedy for paralysis agitans and locomotor
ataxia. He obtained the virus from a captive monster by irritating it
and then letting it strike, or bite, a piece of heavy glass; by this means he
obtained a few drops of a pasty yellowish fluid. In his letters Dr. Belden
quotes Sir John Lubbock as follows):</p></blockquote>

<p>This animal does not bite frequently, but when it does it is
understood that the result is a benumbing paralysis like to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>
paralysis agitans or to locomotor attaxia. There is no tetanic
phase, being, as I apprehend, a condition almost reverse in
objective symptoms to hydrocyanic acid or strychnia.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. Belden also writes):</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that it (the poison) differs in so many points
from all present known venoms that it is worth our having.
In the first place it is alkaline, and all other poisons of reptiles
are acid. Second, its effect is not always sudden but is lasting&mdash;causing
sickness for months and death even after a year.
Again, although it does not produce paralysis it is not the
tonic spasm, but rather the slow creeping death from extremities.
It does not seem to excite but to depress.</p>

<blockquote><p>(A supply of this poison was sent to Dr. Robert Boocock at his request for
proving, and he made three different trials of it, the results of which were
published in the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i> for March and April, 1893; but as
Dr. James E. Lilienthal has arranged the matter in schema form we will here
only give fragmentary quotations from Dr. Boocock's papers, which are
quite long, covering nearly thirty pages. The following is from Dr. Boocock's
paper):</p></blockquote>

<p>I am in my sixtieth year, sanguine, bilious temperament,
fair complexion and weigh 160 pounds; height, 5 feet 6
inches. My normal pulse rate is 72, full, round and regular.
I am in very good health. I do not drink alcoholic beverages
of any kind, neither do I smoke nor drink strong coffee, or tea,
or cocoa. My usual and favorite beverage is hot water with a
little milk and sugar in it. If much sugar or salt is used my
stomach gets very sour, and water-brash is the result. I therefore
use very little of either, though I am very fond of sweetmeats.</p>

<p>When I received the first bottle of <i>Heloderma horridus</i>, I
took a one drachm vial and filled it with the 6x trit., and dissolved
it in four ounces of diluted alcohol, of which I took a
few drops, dried my fingers on my tongue, and a severe feeling
of internal coldness, so intense as to cause me to fear
being frozen to death, ensued. I had some twitches about my
heart, as if the blood was hard to get in or out. I was some<span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>what
alarmed, but as I had no trembling I sat over the register
and tried to get warm. The day was a very cold one, but my
office was comfortably warm, and I had no consciousness of
having taken cold.</p>

<p>I was not surprised at feeling this so soon after taking the
few drops, for I know that I am very sensitive to any medicine
and have a bad habit of tasting medicine, but never without
being conscious of its effects, sometimes very unpleasantly so.</p>

<p>Now, to-day is warm and damp, thunderstorm this morning,
although it is December 9th. The storm lasted three or more
hours; lightning very vivid. I had already taken one drop
of the 30th, with a very severe nervous headache, but I forgot
that when I took the medicine. I have medicated 2 oz. No.
35 globules with 30th dilution, and having taken six globules
as a dose before they were dry.</p>

<p>A feeling of heat in head and face, some headache over the
right eyebrow. Cold feeling in my legs; after two hours a
numb feeling around and down my left thigh; feeling very
drowsy, so took a short nap in my chair. Was awakened suddenly
with a jerking in my head. Central part of frontal
bone so queer as to awaken me.</p>

<p>When my office bell rang it threw me into a startled and
trembling condition, something new to me. At 5:30 took four
globules more.</p>

<p>8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The pressure at my heart and in my head and scalp
is very great. A feeling of great heat and some pressure. Not
so much burning in my face, but a feeling on my left cheek
as if being pricked with points of ice. A very severe and
tired feeling, with coldness of legs and feet. A slight dryness
of my lips, with a tingling feeling and great dryness in my
throat. Gurgling in the region of the spleen.</p>

<p>9:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The pressure and heat on the top of my head
appears like an inflammation of the meninges. It does not
affect my mind; that remains clear, and I can think and read
as well and as long as ever. No more medicine. * * *</p>

<p>December 29, 1892. No medicine. Some trembling, but<span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>
not so great or so extensive; it does not now extend along the
whole limb. Parts of right arm and left thigh hemiplegial; no
acute feeling. But some muscles will twitch and tremble for
a few seconds. Just enough to arrest my attention and amuse
me, and feel like saying, "Hello, <i>Heloderma hor</i>! have you
not done with me yet?" For it is a great surprise to me how
these feelings will come on and creep over me. And I am
inclined to ask myself, can it be that all these strange and to
me new feelings can be the effects following the taking of
these few doses? And yet, if it were necessary, I could swear
they were. I have my fears if I will ever be free from these
nervous trembling spells, and the feeling in my head and
heart.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The foregoing gives the gist of the first trials. The third and last now
follows. It was made with repeated doses of the 30th potency.)</p></blockquote>

<p>12 meridian. Sensation as if a cold, freezing wind were
blowing upon me from the bend of my knees. Head feeling
as if the scalp were being drawn tight over my skull, and my
facial muscles were being drawn very tight over the bones.
A giddiness and a cold pressure from within the skull. A
cold, running chill from superior maxillary down to the chin.
Trembling of limbs. Coldness extending from the knee into
the calf of the leg. Pain and pressure within the skull from
crown to occiput, and from back forward over the left eye.
A very drowsy feeling. I could sleep if I gave way to the
feeling. * * * *</p>

<p>January 4, 1893, 7:45 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Took another dose of six globules.
Pulse, 72. Temperature, 97 3·5. A flush of heat in
my face. A feeling as if I were walking on sponge or as if
my feet were swollen. Dull headache. The arctic cold feeling
is more in my right arm, elbow joint, and right thigh and
left foot. A great trembling of my arm. It is hard work to
steady my hand, which holds my book, enough to continue
reading or writing.</p>

<p>The feeling of swelling in my feet of walking on sponges<span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span>
sensation continues; a springiness, with a sense of looseness
in stepping out, which requires some caution, as if I were not
sure of my steps. The trembling of my hands is on the increase;
feeling of soreness in my heart, more under left
nipple; pain in my back, lumbar region. Some little scalding
of urine; flow not so free and full, intermitting slightly,
as if I had some calculus in the bladder which interfered with
continuous flow. Stool more free and full.</p>

<p>Earwax, which had been very dry, now flows from both
ears, but is more free on the left side. Left nostril sore;
ulcerated. Throat sore and tender to outside touch. * * *</p>

<p>9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Very weak feeling, with pain in my heart; same
place, under left nipple. Head aches and arctic rays in various
parts of my body. * * *</p>

<p>January 5, 12 noon. Took twelve more globules. Numb
feeling in my head. A feeling as if I would fall on my right
side. A good drive this morning in the snowstorm; and felt
a desire to bear to the right side and could not walk straight
because of this, and had repeatedly to stop or step to the left
to get a straight course on the causeway. A good deal of the
same feeling, but very weak and sleepy; was compelled to lie
down, but did not sleep, although feeling very drowsy; laid
very quiet, as if I was in a stupor; the old feeling in various
parts of my body, only more acute; a feeling in various parts
as if a needle were being thrust into my flesh.</p>

<p>4:45 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Took thirteen globules. A very stiff neck the
most prominent feeling. All the previously recorded feelings,
only more intensely. I have a painful boring feeling in the
middle third of left thigh. * * *</p>

<p>8:30. Flushed, hot feeling in my head and face, but no increase
in color; but then I have just come out of the storm.</p>

<p>9:30. Took twelve globules more and retired to rest; very
tired; slept very profoundly until 1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, then could not
sleep. My back, in the lumbar muscles, ached so and my
left leg that I could not sleep for hours, and my brain felt as
if scalded; an intense burning feeling in the meninges, for<span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>
this did not affect my power to think. This hot feeling commenced
and spread down my back. An intense pain over
left eyebrow, through my left eye to base of brain and down
my back. The pain in the back of my head caused me to
bore my head deep into my pillow, and reminded me of cases
I have seen of cerebro-spinal meningitis. An intense weakness,
as if I had no power to move, and no wish to do so, and
yet I was afraid I could not attend to my business. Yet,
strange to say, I was not alarmed, but passively indifferent.
I could not open my eyes without great effort; it was hard
work to keep them open and the easiest thing for them to
close, as if there were a great weight upon them, keeping
them down. I begged to be allowed to remain in bed until
some one wanted me professionally, and yet I could not thus
give way to my feelings, and so got up.</p>

<p>7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Feeling very weak and giddy. Staggering about
my bedroom trying to dress. It was all that I could do to lift
a hod of coal to the stove. The pains in my head and lumbar
muscles, back of my head near atlas and middle third of left
thigh and right elbow are the most noticeable from the great
pains; and arctic coldness in my feet and hands and arms;
have had a transient feeling of pain in the little finger and
little toe of right side. Very feverish or parched in the night,
and my breathing was hard and sounded as if I was drawing
my breath through iron pipes. I feel that I must not take
any more medicine at present. When I remember what a long
time I was in getting to the end of the previous proving, I
feel that I dare not go any further.</p>

<p>The dose I have been taking, a No. 35 globule, is as large as
ten such as is ordinarily used for the 30th or for high dilutions,
so that I have taken as good as sixty high dilution
globules as a dose, and lately as high as one hundred and
twenty-four and sometimes oftener daily.</p>

<p>I was surprised at these hot flushes and burnings in my head
and along my spine. And these strongly reminded me of
some feeling a proving of <i>Gelsemium</i> caused, only that has<span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span>
sweat, whilst this has no moisture, everything being dried up.
Saliva, tears, nostrils, and earwax; the great weakness and
pain in the body reminds me of cerebro-spinal meningitis.</p>

<p>My pulse rate is 68. 8:15. Temperature, 97 only.</p>

<p>1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> What fearful aching in my body! Arctic feeling
throughout my body, except my head and face, and oh! so
tired. A feeling as if it were almost impossible to keep my
eyes open. While out on my professional rounds a feeling
came over me as if it would be far easier to lie down in the
snowy streets than to keep trying to get along. The trembling
is very persistent.</p>

<p>9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Oh! this bad feeling in my head, the aching, aching
in my bones, in every part of my body, head to feet; no part
entirely free from pain, my body so cold; a feeling as if I had
holes in my garments, and cold, frosty winds were blowing
through and freezing my flesh; cold penis and testicles, no
feeling but coldness. A slight gluey discharge; a fluent discharge
from nose, with great sneezing. * * *</p>

<p>January 9th, 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Pulse rate 68; is not so full or jerky,
but it is some. Temperature under the tip of the tongue, 96;
deeper in, 97. This morning awoke at 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and got up to
urinate, but I could not stand without I had hold of something.
Oh, such a weak, giddy feeling! I never fainted but
once, from loss of blood, and these sensations are similar.
Plenty of strength to hold me up, but unable to balance myself,
and when I put forth an effort I staggered about like a
man trying to walk with paralysis or locomotor ataxy. This
idea was the most prominent in my mind, but I have a patient
recovering from paralysis who has to swing his body as he
walks, to get his feet forward, and is very weak and shaky
about his knees, and these sensations very strongly reminded
me of his efforts. His weakness is in his knees, but mine was
from the base of my skull&mdash;cerebrum&mdash;where the pains have
been so persistent near the atlas extending downward. When
I arose, at 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, it was very hard work for me to balance
myself enough to complete dressing myself, and very<span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>
hard work to carry my head. If I bent forward, then it required
great effort to keep from falling on my face or backward.
This lack of balancing power was accompanied by a
sensation of nausea, as if I were going to vomit. I persisted
in my efforts to work, in hopes of shaking off these very
alarming sensations, and by effort got through my morning
work. Whilst shaving a severe jerk of my right arm caused
me to gash my face; very strange, but I ought not to have
tried to do this. I have now some numbness in my right
hand and arm, and a good deal of trembling. Arctic feeling
in my feet and in various parts of my body. This feeling of
want of balancing power does not entirely leave me; a full,
pressing feeling in all parts of my head. And when I walk
I notice I lift my feet higher than usual, or than is necessary,
and I put my heel down hard, as if I was not sure of holding
on to the ground. I notice some twitching, as if my feet
would spring up, making me walk as if I had the cock's gait,
as it is described. * * *</p>

<p>7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, January 10, 1893. Thank God I began this day
with more comfort and more control of myself; my limbs are
easier to manage; a little giddiness and staggering, and stiff,
bruised sensation in my back and lower limbs. My cervical
vertebra is less sore and have little pain; and altogether feel
very much better. My pulse rate is 80 this <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>; full and
round; no jerks perceptible. Temperature 98 under the
tongue, by the root. Mercury very slow in rising; had to
keep the thermometer in a long time. I have a flushed, hot
feeling in my face and head; no trembling, less staggering,
and can manage my limbs fairly well. I feel as I dared not
trifle with myself any further, for I am very weak. A very
little exertion would make me feel very ill. I am feeling like
a man who had just come from under a deadly risk; am very
weak and prostrated, with every nerve on the jump. Oh, so
very weak! A sinking feeling. A parched thirstiness in my
throat and mouth. My tongue is clean; bowels regular; a
good deal of flatus, very fetid; pale yellow, greenish urine<span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>
(specific gravity 1008), smelling very fetid; same smell as the
flatus; more like the smell of rotting sweet fruit or vegetables.
* * *</p>

<p>January 14, 1893. Could not get out of bed at my usual
time; very severe pain in head and back of neck, going down
my back and right leg; twitches, with cold, stinging, ice-needle
pricks. My right hand is feeling as if it were frozen.
Pulse rate 64; full, round, but appears to have a pendulum
motion or twitch. Temperature 96 3-5. Mind clear, but
very weak in my body, and I can not get warm over a hot
register or with hot fluids. This constant arctic cold is very
hard to bear and makes me this morning feel as if I had a
cake of ice on my back. My hands are blue with cold and
my feet feel like lumps of ice. Headache and giddiness;
could not keep from trembling while some patients were in
my consulting room, and had a good deal of difficulty in
steadying and controlling my voice; when excited could not
get hold of the right words I wanted and dropped some when
speaking, from a want of flexibility or a catch in my tongue.
Pains in various parts of my body; the same locations and
character. Quite a rush of business to-day and very ill-fitted
to attend to it. My hands and feet blue and aching with
cold, even while I was sitting over a hot register that scorched
my boot leather, yet no feeling of warmth in hands or feet.
A good deal of throbbing and aching in the upper part of my
kidneys, the right one the sorest. Sharp pains in my bowels,
near the cæcum; some trembling (when asleep it awoke me)
in my right arm and left leg, with a sharp pain near the
ankle joint. * * *</p>

<p>January 20. Awoke this morning in a shivering fit.
Trembling, giddiness and headache, but not very severe.
Cold arctic feeling. Pulse 68. Temperature 97 1-5. My
feet, 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, cold. Severe pain in left testicle, extending
through to the back to anus. Bleed very much from old
piles. An aching at end of penis, and no sexual desire. A
feeling as if the testicles were swollen and painful, as in<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>
orchitis; this is only a transient pain, and comes and goes at
infrequent periods, or remittent in their character. I notice
my urine is taking on the greenish-yellow again, and my
right arm is chilly from the arctic rays. My feet are cold,
and the coldness creeps up higher in my legs. A great deal
of arctic feeling in and around my heart. My breath is cold.
Headache, but mind clear. Cold chills run over me in
various parts of my body. My hands tremble very much at
times, so that I can not write. Pain in testicles and coldness,
as if they were frozen. Pass a large quantity of urine. * *</p>

<p>January 21. 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Did not get up before, owing to the
pressure in my skull, as if it were too full; dropsy or some
swelling of my brain; giddiness, and a numbness down my
left leg, and a jerking upward in both of them. Some trembling
and coldness around my heart, and in my lungs and
down my arms. My feet were very hot in the night until 5
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, when they became cold, numb and jerky, upwards.
My pulse rate is very slow this morning, only 56 beats.
Temperature is slowly forced up to 98. I have a sensation
as if my left cheek were swollen, but it is not so. Trembling
very much in my hands.</p>

<p>2:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Have not been warm yet to-day; very intense
arctic sensation in my body and heart and lungs. Slight
cough. Numbness in my right arm. Much trembling, and
a sensation of inward trembling in all parts of my body.
Generative organs frozen cold, and this coldness extends up
my back. My feet so cold that I have burned my boots, and
yet cannot get them warm. Coldness extends up to my
knees. Stiffness and pain in left thigh. Cold arctic band
round my head, with fulness in skull. Pulse 60. Temperature
97 4-5. Good appetite. Mentally clear, although very
weak; very tired and discouraged that these feelings last so
long. They seem to be all beginning over again; worse
now than they were a week ago. I feel more like giving up
and going to bed sick, but I cannot afford to do so, so I brace<span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>
up and resist this temptation to try and find an antidote for
these recurring series of feelings. * * *</p>

<p>January 23. Slept well until 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>; then awoke with
pains in head and burning in my feet, with some trembling
and stiff feeling in my lungs and heart, as if they were tied or
unable to move. As I lay awake I could hear my heart
pounding away, but, oh! so slow. Felt very weak and
wanted to stay in bed, but after some hard thinking I got up.
7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Very weak; staggered about while dressing. Pains
in the base of the brain. Pulse 64 and irregular in its beats,
some of them failing altogether to declare themselves only by
their absence to respond. Temperature, after being held
under my tongue ten minutes, 97 2-5. Very cold in my back
and over my shoulders; hands and feet are blue with cold.
Itching all over my body, and as if I was bitten with fleas or
bugs were crawling over me. Skin of my hands very rough
and cracks are in them. My ears have a feeling as if wax were
running out of them. * * *</p>

<p>January 26, 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> It has required a mighty effort to keep
up this day. My pulse 56, slow and irregular; temperature
98. Headache, yet mind clear; backache. Weakness in all
my body; my limbs so weak in walking that it was difficult
to keep going, and felt as if I could lay down or drop down
anywhere. What heart failure symptoms are I do not know,
but fear I came very near it and yet I have resisted this feeling,
and kept awake and about. Have felt very ill all the
day, and am so now on retiring, 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> * * *</p>

<p>January 29. 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Just after breakfast, pulse 68, temperature
99; slept very heavy, but dreamed of treating many
cases of black diphtheria. Awoke, slept, dreamed the same
dream again, and again the same dream, three separate times.
How very singular! During these provings, I have done this
three separate times. Three dreams in one night&mdash;the same
dream, the same disease, the same families in my dream. This
singularity caused me to lay awake wondering what this can
mean. I have not any patients suffering from this disease,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and I do not know of any in the town, and nothing that I
know of to bring this disease to my mind. Awoke feeling
very stiff and sore. * * *</p>

<p>January 30. Head pains again, the same old character.
Sensation of swelling in my face and pain in nerves of teeth,
molars. Hot feeling. Pulse, 68. Temperature, 99. Very
weak, but my mind clear. Much trembling and the oppression
round my heart and chest producing a suffocating feeling
that makes me afraid, and I must now seek some means to
arrest this difficulty and give me some relief. I know it looks
cowardly to give up, but my family compels me to do something
to enable me to keep about. I cannot do any more;
this heart oppression makes me think of heart failure. Pulse,
56, and temperature 96. Very weak. I hope it will wear
away and this trembling improve. They have been caused
by this drug, one of the most powerful. I gave up and went
to bed very ill. I had to keep it from my family, but I was
afraid my heart would stop beating and had a very restless
night. I took acetic acid, as vinegar I had in some pickles I
thought changed or relieved the first class or effort of provings
and caused me to stop and begin again. I think it did
help me. Next day very prostrated but did not take any note
of my pulse or temperature, because I had began to try to
find an antidote, and this vinegar and lemon juice has relieved
many of them. I fear sometimes that the trembling in my
hands may never fully leave me now.</p>

<p>February 12, 1893. Copying my notes has brought so
vividly to my memory that I can almost feel the old arctic
rays through my body, and the giddiness and staggering gait
of the <i>Heloderma hor.</i> days. I hope that you may have many
others more courageous than I have been, whose provings
will compare or improve upon this poor effort of mine.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Clinical.</span></p>

<p>The case of paralysis that I spoke of, whose staggering gait
was called to my mind by my feelings, is now taking <i>Heloderma</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>In the following case, Mrs. Ford, eighty-one years of age,
has been my patient several times during the last four years.
She suffered from erysipelas and dropsy in the legs. In
September I was again called in for the same old trouble; the
usual remedies were effectual. In October she caught cold,
and had also a bad fall; her symptoms were those of pneumonia,
fever, delirium and cough, pain in chest and hard
work to breathe, blueness of lips, tongue and cheeks, cold extremities
and was very low in appetite, and appeared to be
sinking. Pulse, fifty; temperature, ninety, and to all human
appearance was rapidly dying; all said so, and I fully believed
so, but left <i>Heloderma horridus</i>, one powder in water, and
ordered her tongue to be moistened with a feather dipped in
this every half hour. I did not call the next day until evening.
I was waiting to be notified of her death, but no such
notice coming called to see, and, to my surprise, found everything
changed. I then gave <i>Helo. hor.</i> 200, every four hours,
with placebos. All the bad symptoms gradually disappeared,
breathing became natural, heart gained strength,
pulse increased to seventy, temperature to ninety-eight and
appetite became better, asking frequently for food. This
continued so long as she was taking this medicine. She
was so well that I ceased to attend, she having no aches
or pains, was eating and sleeping well, bowels moved
regularly and night watching was given up. All who
saw the recovery were pleasingly surprised, and so was I, and
have frequently asked myself could anything else have done
this. <i>Lachesis</i> has changed a slate colored tongue, and has
aroused those who appeared to be dying for a short time, but
to extend the life of one as good as dead for thirty days is a
triumph for the <i>Helo. hor.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>(To the foregoing we may add that some have thought that the proving
was too sensational, but other evidence that has not appeared in print leads
to the conclusion that it is essentially true, and that the proving was made
by one peculiarly susceptible to the remedy. We know of one gentleman
who laughed at it and in bravado took a number of doses during an afternoon.
He felt no immediate effects, but during the night awoke with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
very peculiar feelings that he could attribute to nothing but the <i>Heloderma</i>,
and they were of such a character that he refused to take any more. It
would be well to use the remedy with caution until the practitioner has
gauged its powers.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. Charles E. Johnson wrote as follows to Dr. Boocock concerning the
remedy):</p></blockquote>

<p>"I have had under treatment a case that has been pronounced
incurable by many physicians. She has had most
of the symptoms developed in your proving, that awful coldness
being most pronounced. She has had two doses of the
200th. I learn through a neighbor that she is delighted with
the result of the last medicine. The coldness has nearly disappeared,
leaving a comfortable glow upon the body. She
tells her neighbors this without having been informed by me
what results I expected from the medicine."</p>

<h3>JACARANDA GUALANDAI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Bignoniaceæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Carroba.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The dried leaves are crushed and macerated in
five parts by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Of this South American remedy the <i>Dispensatory</i> says it is used in Brazil
and other South American countries for syphilis; sometimes under the name
<i>Carroba</i>. Its value was also asserted in <i>British Medical Journal</i>, 1885. The
following letter from Dr. J. F. Convers, of Bogota, to Messrs. Boericke &amp;
Tafel, throws some further light on its use; the letter is dated November
24, 1888):</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Dear Gentlemen</i>: Please to accept the leaves of a tree of
the Bignoniacea family, called <i>Jacaranda gualandai</i>, that I
send you with this, because it is very much used by our
natives to cure illness of a syphilitic character. I have used
the mother tincture (5 drops <i>pro dosi</i>), and the 3d dilution of
it, in the treatment of blennorrhagia and chancroids with the
greatest success. In my experience I have found that this
medicine is a complementary and antidote to <i>Merc. v.</i></p>

<p>Mr. José M. Reyes, who proved the &#952; and the 2x dilution
during more than one month three times a day, found the
following results:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Head.</span>&mdash;Vertigo on rising after stooping, with momentary
loss of sight, and sensation of heaviness in the forehead.
Weakness of memory and inability to study.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eyes.</span>&mdash;<i>Pains and inflammation of the eyes, with redness
more marked in the left eye. Sensation of sand in both eyes.</i>
Ophthalmia, which begins in the left eye, with lachrymation
and night agglutination of the eyelids. Weakness of sight.
Syphilitic-like ophthalmia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stool.</span>&mdash;Diarrh&#339;a with dark mulberry-colored stools without
pain or tenesmus, but with mucus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Urinary and Sexual Organs.</span>&mdash;Increased secretion of
the urine. Pain in the penis. <i>Blennorrhagia</i> with a dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>charge
which stains the linen a dirty yellow color. <i>Chancroids.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Throat.</span>&mdash;Pain and burning of the larynx, when laughing
or reading aloud, and small vesicles in the pharynx.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Back.</span>&mdash;Weakness of the lumbar region.</p>

<p>These are not doubtful symptoms.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;This remedy acts on the head at first, afterwards on
the intestines, and on the eyes last.</p>

<p>Please try it, and make it known to our colleagues. Should
it prove to be there as good as here, I assure you it will be a
valued remedy.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. J. S. Whittinghill contributed the following, <i>Eclectic Medical Journal</i>,
concerning <i>Jacaranda</i>):</p></blockquote>

<p>Let me give the results of my experience with <i>Jacaranda</i>.
I believe it to be a true specific for certain kinds of rheumatism.
Its first trial was given a patient suffering as follows:
She had had rheumatism for about ten years&mdash;never became
serious. Sometimes she was nearly relieved from it; again
lost much rest and sleep from it. Her wrist would become
painful and very weak from ordinary labor. She always
suffered very much in the morning upon any motion, and
complained of being stiff. Had to have assistance in dressing.
Upon sudden motion, sensation in the muscles as of
tearing and being bruised&mdash;even painful upon pressure.</p>

<p>I gave her different remedies as they seemed to be indicated,
with no results towards removing the trouble. I
thought there could be nothing lost by trying <i>Jacaranda</i>. It
met with decided success. She was entirely relieved of muscular
pains in a few days. Had the recurrence of some symptoms
in about six weeks after; tried <i>Jacaranda</i> again with
the same decided success. Some eight weeks have elapsed
since, with no recurrence of muscular pains. I have tried it
on three other patients with the same peculiar morning stiffness
and soreness of muscles. All were relieved in a few
days. They have no more muscular trouble. So I put morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>ing
soreness and stiffness of muscles as the guide in prescribing
<i>Jacaranda</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3>LAC CANINUM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The fresh milk from a bitch is triturated in
the usual way.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The late Dr. Sam. Swan had a proving of this remedy, dog milk, in the
Materia Medica he attempted to publish, but of which only one volume appeared.
The work is now very rare. The following clinical cases were contributed
by Dr. Philip Rice to the <i>Medical Century</i>, Vol. IX, No. 24):</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lac caninum</i> is a remedy of undoubted value, though not
very thoroughly understood and consequently not very extensively
used in this dread disease. And since a proving
has never been made, and since we have to depend entirely
upon clinical reports I feel it my duty to report a few cases in
which a clear demonstration of the value of this remedy was
made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case I.</span>&mdash;Bruce McG., æt. 15, dark hair, gray eyes, spare
habit, rigid fibre, nervous, quick, active, called at my office in
the evening complaining of sore throat, worse on right side,
and on swallowing. Headache dull and heavy, slight fever.
Inspection revealed tonsils and fauces congested and angry
looking. On right tonsil a patch of membrane the size of a
split pea was seen.</p>

<p><i>Lycopodium</i> 30x was given. The next morning the entire
trouble seemed to have gone to the left side; with it had
come, also, stiff neck and tongue; profuse flow of saliva;
temperature 101 F. Membrane somewhat larger. <i>Mercurius
ruber</i> 30x was given. In the evening the trouble was worse
again on right side, the membrane now entirely covering both
tonsils, temperature 102 F. Limbs ached, back ached, and
patient was restless. Remembering the symptom, "membrane
alternates between right and left sides," and this having been<span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>
so characteristic, I gave <i>Lac caninum</i> in the 30th potency.
Improvement began immediately and at the end of the third
day the membrane was entirely gone and case discharged as
far as medicine was concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case II.</span>&mdash;Louisa McG., æt. 13, in temperament exactly
like her brother, the preceding case. Was irritable and listless
for two days, but owing to the fact that the fair began in a
few days, to which she was determined to go, she did not
complain. The third day, however, her mother noticed that
she was truly sick and, there being a number of cases of
diphtheria in town, looked into her throat. She found
both tonsils covered with a membrane. I was called and as
no other symptoms could be elicited I gave <i>Sulphur</i> 30x and
told them I would call again in the evening, which I did and
found symptoms rapidly developing. Aching in all the limbs;
headache; pain in the throat on swallowing; worse on the
right side; neck and tongue stiff; membrane just the same.
Temperature 101.5; same remedy continued.</p>

<p>Next morning the membrane was the same, pain now in
left side, throat internally and externally &#339;dematous, fauces
and uvula glossy or varnished in appearance. Temperature
102, urine scanty, no thirst. <i>Apis</i> 30x was now given. In
the evening pain back in right side again. Temperature
102.5. Membrane spreading; stiffness of neck and tongue
more marked and saliva profuse. Not having seen the case
till the membrane had quite generally formed, but the patient
being in temperament like her brother and the pain shifting
from side to side, as in his case, I decided to give her <i>Lac caninum</i>.
Improvement began immediately and at the end of four
days the membrane was entirely gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case III.</span>&mdash;The servant girl in the family where cases one
and two had been, Anna B., æt. 17. In temperament the
very opposite to the other cases, being fat, fair and flabby.
Complained of pain in right side of throat on swallowing,
neck stiff, tonsil slightly congested. Felt as if she had a bad
cold. Advised her to come to the office and get some medi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>cine.
She had, however, some "dope" on hand and said she
guessed she would take that first. Next evening I was called
and found her with throat much worse. Membrane covering
left tonsil entirely, also a narrow strip of membrane on
posterior wall of pharynx, pain in left tonsil on swallowing,
neck and tongue stiff, saliva quite profuse. Temperature only
slightly above normal. <i>Lac caninum</i> 30x was given. Patient
never went to bed and at the end of the second day no trace
of membrane could be seen.</p>

<p>Now, the symptoms common to all three cases and the
only ones characteristic in each case were, first, both pain and
membrane shifting from side to side; second, stiffness of neck
and tongue; third, profuse saliva; fourth, aching in limbs
marked; fifth, entire absence of prostration; sixth, character
of pain was "as if throat was burned raw." Now, the question
will arise in the bacteria man's mind, was this real diphtheria;
were the German's bacteria present? I will answer
candidly, I don't know; I never looked for them.</p>

<h3>LAPIS ALBUS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Synonym.</span> Silico-Fluoride of Calcium.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The residue obtained by evaporation, from the
waters of the mineral springs of Gastein, Germany, is triturated
in the usual way.</p>

<blockquote><p>(It was Von Grauvogl who first called attention to this drug, the product of
certain mineral springs in Germany, that have reputation for curing ulcers,
cancers, tumors, etc. In the Transactions of the American Institute of Hom&#339;opathy,
1896, will be found the following by Dr. W. A. Dewey):</p></blockquote>

<p>My experience with this remedy, and I have been somewhat
interested in it, dates from about 1876. At that time a
member of my own family had an enlargement of one of the
cervical glands. It was nearly as large as a hen's egg, and
had a soft, doughy feel. Under <i>Lapis albus</i> 6, prescribed, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
believe, by Dr. G. E. E. Sparhawk, now of Burlington, Vt.,
the swelling speedily and completely disappeared. A peculiar
and unusual symptom noticed by this patient while taking
the medicine was a marked increase in the appetite; it became
ravenous.</p>

<p>Since that time I have used the remedy in many cases of
scrofulous enlargement of the cervical glands, and find that
it is almost specific where the glands have a certain amount
of elasticity and pliability about them, rather than a stony
hardness, such as might call for <i>Calcarea fluorica</i>, <i>Cistus</i> or
<i>Carbo animalis</i>.</p>

<p>One case in particular which I recall was a young lady,
about twenty years of age, a natural blonde, skin fair, bluish
white, showing prominent veins, who had a glandular enlargement
in the right supra-clavicular region, nearly the size
of a goose egg, and one somewhat smaller a little farther back
in the interval between the sterno-cleido mastoid and trapezius
muscles. These had a certain amount of hardness, but they
were movable. Others of the cervical chain were also enlarged,
the right side being the only one affected. As the
young lady was engaged to be married, these unsightly lumps
were very distressing. <i>Lapis albus</i> 6, a powder four times a
day, in a week caused a marked diminution of the size of the
glands, and in three weeks they were not noticeable, and
eventually entirely disappeared. This patient also had a
ravenous appetite while taking the remedy, an unusual thing
for her. Her anæmic color and complexion were also greatly
improved.</p>

<p>The most remarkable effect of the use of the remedy I have
had was in the case of goitre in a lady of about thirty-five,
blonde, who had for over a year noticed a gradual increase in
the size of the thyroid gland, until it was as large as a good-sized
fist, when she came to me. Both halves of the gland
seemed to be equally involved. It did not appear to be of the
encapsulated variety. This patient had received previous hom&#339;opathic
treatment, having had <i>Spongia</i>, <i>Iodine</i>, <i>Thuja</i>, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
well as some other remedies. <i>Lapis albus</i> 6 was prescribed, a
dose every three hours. The swelling began to disappear at
once, and continued to diminish in size until it completely
disappeared, and at the present time over five years have
passed with no return of the trouble.</p>

<h3>LATRODECTUS MACTANS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The spiders are triturated in the usual way.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following paper by Dr. Samuel A. Jones appeared in the <i>Hom&#339;opathic
Recorder</i>, July, 1889, under the title, "Latrodectus Mactans: a Suggested
Remedy in Angina Pectoris"):</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"The great result of the grim doctor's labor, so far as known to the public,
was a certain preparation or extract of cobwebs, which, out of a great abundance
of material, he was able to produce in any desirable quantity, and by
the administration of which he professed to cure diseases of the inflammatory
class, and to work very wonderful effects upon the human system."&mdash;<i>Dr.
Grimshawe's Secret.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>I do not know that the doctor who is the direct occasion of
this paper was <i>grim</i>, nor do I imagine he ever dreamed of
such an application of his paper as I purpose to make. I
never met him; though he wore the gray and I the blue during
a struggle wherein fate might easily have thrown us
together. It was not until the autumn of '76 that I became
aware of his existence, and then by a contribution of his to a
medical magazine&mdash;the special copy of which was found
amongst the multifarious waifs of a bookstall. I could not
"decline the article," although I was then entering upon a
field of labor that would leave little time for such quiet research
as the old doctor's paper so powerfully suggested, so I
bought the odd number, and fourteen years later I am making
such use of it as my sense of its significance enforces.</p>

<p>It is due Mr. A. J. Tafel to state that but for his most efficient
services this paper of mine would never have been<span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span>
written. To his endeavors, stretching through some years, I
owe the identification of the remedy, without which I should
not have put pen to paper; and having secured this, from unimpeachable
authority, too, he never rested from his labors
until he had put in my possession dilutions of the poison
itself. If, then, this <i>magis venenum</i> shall prove itself <i>magis
remedium</i>, most assuredly the <i>pars magna</i> of its introduction
is his.</p>

<p>From the days of Dioscorides and Pliny to the present a
venomous quality has been ascribed to "the fluid emitted
from the orifice in the fangs of the arancidæ." That this
quality was even lethal has been both believed and questioned.
<i>Insect Life</i>, Vol. I., No. 7, pp. 204-211, Washington,
1889, contains "A Contribution to the Literature of Fatal
Spider Bites," in which the credulity of mere medical observers
and the emphatic incredulity of professed "entomologists
and arachnologists" are dwelt upon, and concerning which
its author cautiously concludes as follows:</p>

<p>"It will possibly appear to the reader that after collecting
this testimony we are as far from the solution of the question&mdash;'Do
spider bites ever produce fatal results?'&mdash;as we were
before; but it seems to us, after analyzing the evidence, that
it must at least be admitted that certain spiders of the genus
Latrodectus have the power to inflict poisonous bites which
may (probably exceptionally and depending upon exceptional
conditions) bring about the death of a human being. Admitting
in its fullest force the argument that in reported
cases the spider has seldom if ever been seen by a reliable
observer to inflict the wound, we consider that the fact that
species of the Latrodectus, occurring in such widely distant
localities as South Europe, the Southern United States, and
New Zealand, are uniformly set aside by the natives as poisonous
species, when there is nothing especially dangerous in
their appearance, is the strongest argument for believing that
these statements have some verification in fact. It is no
wonder that a popular fear should follow the ferocious-look<span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>ing
spiders of the family Theraphosoidæ; but considering
the comparatively small size and modest coloring of the
species of Latrodectus so wide-spread a prejudice, occurring
in so many distinct localities, must be well founded." P. 211.</p>

<p>Is it indeed an <i>argument</i> that "in reported cases the spider
has seldom if ever been seen by a reliable observer to inflict
the wound?" How an Orfila, a Christison, and a Caspar
would smile when asked if the evidence of a poisonous
quality depended upon the administration of the poison being
"seen by a reliable observer." Toxicology detects a poison
by the physiological test as well as the chemical. Strychnia
in quantity too small for the coarse chemical test is revealed
by the tetanized muscles of a frog whether that "arch martyr
to science" be in "South Europe, the Southern United States,
or New Zealand," and that infinitesimal fractions of Strychnia
will display its characteristics whether or not its administration
is "seen" by a Christison, or a college janitor. Of
course, a Christison would recognize Strychnia from and in
the phenomena, while a college janitor (and here and there
an over-scientific entomologist) might not.</p>

<p>It is neither the aim nor the purpose of this paper to establish
the lethal property of spider poison; though I must
acknowledge that, until I read the paper in <i>Insect Life</i>, I had
no thought that its possession of such a property would be
called in question. I shall content myself with calling attention
to the pathogenetic quality of the poison of <i>Latrodectus
mactans</i>, leaving my reader to discern the resemblance of its
<i>tout ensemble</i> to an attack of angina pectoris, and therefore to
infer its hom&#339;opathic applicability in that dread disorder. I
shall not enter upon the pathology&mdash;various and much confused&mdash;of
that cardiac seizure, because, as I get older, I find
the "like" more and more of a "pillar of cloud by day and
pillar of fire by night," whilst in my short life I have found
"pathology" as changeable as a dying dolphin&mdash;and every
one knows that a dead fish "stinks and shines, and shines
and stinks."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cases of Spider Bite.</span></h3>

<p>BY G. WILLIAM SEMPLE, M. D., HAMPTON, VA.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>"Spider bites are of rare occurrence in this vicinity, but are
generally productive of grave symptoms. [Isn't it bad taste
for doctors to use the words grave symptoms?] I will report
all that have occurred to me in a practice of forty years:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Case I.</span> September 4, 1853. I was called to see Mr. D., at
Old Point, who had been bitten by a small, black spider on
the prepuce, whilst on the privy seat, at 12:30 o'clock. The
bite at first caused only itching of the prepuce, with a little
redness of the part, but in less than half an hour <i>nausea</i>, followed
by <i>severe abdominal pains</i>, ensued. A messenger was
dispatched in haste for me to Hampton, three miles off. Before
I reached the patient, at 2:30 o'clock, <i>violent præcordial
pains extending to the axilla, and down the</i> [left] <i>arm and
forearm to the fingers</i>, with <i>numbness of the extremity</i>, had
succeeded, attended by <i>apnæa</i>.</p>

<p>"In consequence of the violence of the symptoms, Dr.
Stineca, surgeon of the post, had been sent for, who had given
two doses of <i>Laudanum</i> of &#658;j each, and two of rectified whiskey
of &#495;ij each, and, being in ill health and unable to remain,
had ordered his steward to apply four dry cups over the præcordia.
This had just been done when I arrived. I saw the
<i>blood, thin and florid</i>, fill the cups like water oozing through
the muslin. When the cups were removed, the <i>blood</i>, emptied
into a basin, <i>did not coagulate</i>; and blood continued to
ooze slightly from the surfaces to which the cups had been
applied until the next morning, though a solution of <i>Tannin</i>
was applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>"I found the patient <i>suffering extremely from the most violent
præcordial pains and from apnæa</i>, and also <i>violent pain in the
left</i> arm, which was almost <i>paralyzed</i>. His <i>pulse</i> was 130
<i>and very feeble</i>, his <i>skin cold</i> as marble, and his <i>countenance
expressive of the deep anxiety</i> he felt and expressed in words.
The laudanum and whiskey seemed to have produced no
effect&mdash;the nausea and abdominal pains having subsided
before they were administered. There was no pain, inflammation,
or swelling where the bite was received. Even the
itching of the part had subsided. I gave the patient every
half hour for several hours &#658;j of aromatic spirits of ammonia,
and as much whiskey and water as he could be induced to
take, and afterwards gave them every hour; also pediluvia of
hot mustard and water, frequently repeated, until the next
night.</p>

<p>"September 5th, 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;The symptoms continued unabated;
indeed, the patient grew worse until 2:30 o'clock,
twenty-six hours after he was bitten, for his <i>pulse</i> had then
become <i>so frequent that it could not be counted, and so feeble
that it could scarcely be felt</i>. He then <i>vomited black vomit</i>
copiously&mdash;a quart or more. Soon afterwards reaction set in,
his pulse gradually gained force, and became less frequent,
the pain subsided and the respiration improved. At 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>,
the pulse had gained considerable force, and the patient slept
until some minutes after 12; his pulse was pretty full at 1:10;
his surface warm and perspirable, and he felt almost free of
pain. After a short interval he again fell asleep, and slept
quietly until morning, when he awoke&mdash;his respiration
healthy, pulse 80, regular and with sufficient force, and entirely
relieved of pain. He soon afterwards had <i>two pretty
copious evacuations from the bowels</i>, similar to the black vomit
he had vomited. After this he said he felt quite well, and
took a light breakfast and dinner, and returned that evening
to his residence in Portsmouth, and in a few days went to
work at his trade.</p>

<p>"In thirty-six hours from the time he was bitten, he took<span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>
three and a half quart bottles of the best rectified whiskey&mdash;about
three quarts without showing the least symptom of intoxication."</p>

<p>I have cited this case at full length in order to present the
<i>evolution of the symptoms</i>, on which alone depends the resemblance
of the action of the poison to the chief symptoms of
an attack of angina pectoris&mdash;a closer resemblance than half
a lifetime of somewhat wide reading has enabled me to find
in the effect of any other noxious agent. In fact, after much
searching, I find this case to be unique. In other cases of
spider bite I can find evidence that assures me of its genuineness,
but, to my knowledge, its <i>order of symptom evolution</i>
is as solitary as it is singular and significant. This feature of
<i>uniqueness</i> will cause many to regard it with suspicion. I
think they will do wrong; for some experience in proving
work has taught me that one positive result from a drug out-weighs
any number of negative.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>Latrodectus mactans</i> we shall find, from
other poisonings, that, as a rule, it displays an affinity for the
præcordial region as the <i>locus</i> of its chief attack; and having
assurance of that fact, we shall not find it difficult to accept a
clue from even a solitary instance.</p>

<p>Of the remaining cases in Dr. Semple's paper I shall cite
only the symptoms, and be it observed that in all the cases as
here given the italics are my own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case 2.</span> A man "was bitten in the groin, and complained
of only a slight prickling and itching at the spot where he
was bitten, but was complaining [when Dr. S. saw him] of
<i>severe abdominal pain</i>, with <i>nausea</i>, and a <i>sinking sensation
at the epigastrium</i>; and his <i>pulse</i>, in a few minutes after the
bite, had already become <i>quick and thready</i>; and the <i>skin
very cold</i>." The man soon recovered under ammonia and
whiskey&mdash;two quarts of the latter produced no symptoms of
intoxication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case III.</span> A lad of eighteen years of age. "There was no
pain, but only itching and redness at the part bitten at first;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>
but <i>violent pain soon commenced there</i> [on the back of the left
hand] <i>and extended in a short time up the forearm and arm
to the shoulder and thence to the præcordial region</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case IV.</span> "A tawny woman [daughter of a quadroon mulatto
woman] about twenty-two years old, the mother of two
children." "Found her <i>apparently moribund</i>; her <i>skin</i> as
<i>cold</i> as marble; <i>violent pain extending from the bite on the
right wrist up the forearm and arm to the shoulder, and thence
up the neck to the back of the head on the right side</i>; more
<i>violent pain in the præcordia</i>, <i>extending thence to the shoulder
and axilla on the left, and down the arm and forearm to the
ends of the fingers</i>, and <i>this extremity partially paralysed</i>;
added to this, <i>apnæa was extreme; the respiration only occasional&mdash;gasping</i>;
the <i>pulse could not be felt in the left radial</i>,
and I was not sure that I felt it in the right."</p>

<p>In about fifteen minutes after the intra-venous injection of
13 minims of undiluted <i>Aqua Ammoniæ</i>, the doctor "was astonished
at the calm and painless expression of her <i>countenance</i>,
so lately <i>expressive of anxiety and pain</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case V.</span> A healthy young girl of 13. She felt a stinging
sensation on the [right] wrist, accompanied by itching and
redness at the spot [bitten]. For several minutes there was
but little pain, but in half an hour a <i>painful sensation</i> began
to be felt at the spot, which quickly <i>extended up the arm to
the shoulder</i>, and, in the course of an hour, <i>along the neck to
the back of the head</i>. * * * <i>Pain in the præcordial region,
with apnæa</i> coming on, I was sent for. When I arrived she
was screaming fearfully with <i>pain</i>, and frequently exclaiming
she would <i>lose her breath and die</i>. The <i>pulse</i> had become
<i>thready</i> and the <i>surface cold</i>.</p>

<p>From these <i>data</i> the poison of <i>Latrodectus mactans</i> is suggested
for trial in <i>angina pectoris</i>, in that its physiological
action presents the closest <i>similimum</i> yet found.</p>

<p class="title">II.</p>

<p>It may be well to offer a critical examination of the foregoing
cases. If they are genuine effects of the poison of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>
<i>Latrodectus mactans</i>, they must afford a <i>recurrence of corresponding
symptoms</i>. They may differ in <i>degree</i>, because the
quality of the venom may vary; first, from the season in
which the bite occurred (and judging from cases I, IV and V,
the poison of <i>Latrodectus mactans</i> is most virulent in the
month of September), and, secondly, from the more thorough
elaboration of the venom. It is known that the poison of
<i>Crotalus horridus</i> differs in intensity according to the frequency
with which the snake has bitten in a given period of
time; of four successive "strikes" in four different organisms,
and at brief intervals, the intensity of the action will vary, so
that while the first wound is lethal the last is not&mdash;on which
fact depends the vaunted reputation of many an antidote to
the bite of the rattlesnake. That this may be also true of the
spider poison is the only explanation I can offer for the fact
that many naturalists have allowed themselves to be bitten by
spiders of reputed poisonous species, and with impunity.</p>

<p>While Dr. Semple's reports do not precisely state it, I think
we may safely infer a <i>sense of impending dissolution</i> in cases<span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span>
I, IV and V. The girl exclaimed she "would lose her breath
and die;" the man in case I "expressed in words" "the
deep anxiety he felt;" the woman in case IV was found "apparently
moribund" with "gasping respiration," and therefore
incapable of speech, but who can doubt that she had <i>a
sense of impending dissolution?</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Isolated Symptoms.</span></p>

</ul>

<p>It must be admitted that many of our accepted provings
cannot as well bear a similar test.</p>

<p class="title">III.</p>

<p>There is another feature that the believer in the law of
similars should find no insuperable difficulty in accepting as a
criterion of the validity of a proving, namely: <i>the similarity
of the drug symptoms to certain disease symptoms</i>. I am not
ready to believe that drug symptoms are only the result of
a "fortuitous concourse of atoms," nor can I for one moment
imagine that they are the product of blind and aimless chance.
I plainly discern in them the result of law, and I am wholly
unable to conceive of existing law without the absolutely
necessary <i>pre</i>-existing law maker. The consequent must
have its antecedent. Therefore, in a drug symptom I see a
purpose, and by the light of the law of similars I find the
purpose of a drug symptom in an analogous disease symptom&mdash;they
answer to each other as face unto face in the refiner's
silver&mdash;and behind and beyond them both is another purpose,
of wisdom inscrutable, of love unfathomable. In a word, my
reader, the problem of the visible universe forces upon me
the alternative that weighed upon Marcus Aurelius&mdash;"either
gods, or atoms." With atoms only I cannot account for law;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>
with God and in God both atoms and law find a meaning and
a purpose.</p>

<p>If I were submitting these convictions, or, if you will, this
"working hypothesis," to a Sir Thomas Browne, or a William
Harvey, or a Thomas Sydenham I should feel no momentary
hesitation; as it is, I can only hope that the spirit that filled
these worthies is not extinct in days when the "spiritual
colic" that disordered an imaginary <i>Robert Elsmere</i> is thought
to disturb the eternal Verities. I much doubt if they who
mistake an eclipse for an annihilation will get any good from
this poor pen of mine.</p>

<p>The resemblance between the symptoms of angina pectoris
and the effects of the poison of <i>Latrodectus mactans</i> are so
striking as to justify the presentation of a comparison; and
it is hoped that physicians of wide reading will pardon what
may seem to them a piece of supererogation for the sake of
many a humbler practitioner whose opportunities have not
been so happy. At the same time, the widest reader must
admit that he has not found any one authority who has given
a complete picture of angina pectoris. Nor is it essential that
such an all-including "composite" shall now be presented;
on the contrary, we shall offer only salient points substantiated
by observers of the highest order.</p>

<p>It will be well to start from an authority whose scholarship
has never been excelled&mdash;<i>Copland</i>. Of all our medical writers
he may be called the <i>Great Definer</i>&mdash;his readers will know
what that means.</p>

<p>"<i>Acute constricting pain at the lower part of the sternum,
inclining to the left side, and extending to the arm, accompanied
with great anxiety, difficulty of breathing, tendency to
syncope, and feeling of approaching dissolution.</i>"</p>

<p>Copland presents a group of constants, and, for a terse definition,
has well covered the principal phenomena. As variants
he has omitted the pulse and the surface temperature. He
errs on the side of dogmatism in defining the character of the
pain as "constricting;" "aching, burning, or indescribable,"<span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>
and "generally attended with a sense of constriction" is more
in accordance with the actual condition. Of Copland's seven
constants, Case 4 presents an analogue for each in symptoms
IX., V., III., VIII., XII., and the "tendency to syncope,"
which is not included in our table because Dr. Semple did not
put the fact in express words. If to this group we add the
<i>thready pulse</i> and <i>cold skin</i>, we shall have "covered" nine of
the most prominent symptoms of angina pectoris; a pathological
"composite" with a most striking pathogenetic <i>similimum</i>.</p>

<p>But all the elements of Copland's group are not of equal
importance; two of them, at least, are pathognomonic. "The
two constituent elements of the paroxysm," says Latham, are
"the sense of dissolution and the pain." "Pain with one
awful accompaniment may be everything." "This mixture
of the sharpest pain with a feeling of instant death." According
to Fothergill "the two prominent subjective phenomena
are pain in the chest and a sense of impending death." Eulenburg
and Guttmann include another element: "We regard
the substernal pain, the feeling of anxiety, and the disturbance
of the heart's action, as the essential symptoms of angina
pectoris." Romberg notes the companionship of these two
elements: "The patient attacked with angina pectoris is suddenly
seized with a pain under the sternum in the neighborhood
of the heart, accompanied by a sense of anxiety so intense
as to induce a belief in the approach of death."</p>

<p>We have laid the emphasis of these various citations on the
"essential symptoms" in order to assert, with equal emphasis,
that their analogues occur in not only one case of <i>Latrodectus
mactans</i> poisoning. The præcordial pain is noted in Cases 1,
3, 4 and 5, and the sense of impending dissolution in Cases 1,
4 and 5. And that disturbance of the heart's action which
Eulenburg and Guttmann consider an essential element is
found in Cases 1, 2, 4 and 5; so that the <i>tout ensemble</i> presented
by Case 4 is corroborated.</p>

<p>Another important element, though it is one subject to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>
variations, is the direction of the extension of the pain. It
most generally extends to the left axilla, and down the arm
to the fingers; as variations it sometimes affects the right
axilla and the back of the head. In Cases 1 and 4 the spider
poison followed the direction of the disease, and in Cases 4
and 5 it also affected the back of the head. In Case 1 it produced
the numbness of the arm and hand that is sometimes
observed in the diseases.</p>

<p>Copland includes "difficulty of breathing" amongst the elements
of angina pectoris. Trousseau does not regard this difficulty
as real. "Although patients think they are going to be
suffocated during a paroxysm, the chest is normally resonant
on percussion, and if it be auscultated as they draw in breath
again vesicular breathing is heard everywhere." Watson says,
"the patient is not necessarily out of breath. It is not dyspn&#339;a
that oppresses him; for he can, and generally does, breathe
freely and easily." Stokes is decided: "Respiration is <i>secondarily</i>
affected; there may be slight dyspn&#339;a or orthopn&#339;a,
with lividity of the face, yet by an effort of the will (if the
patient dares to encounter the pang this commonly produces)
the chest may be pretty freely expanded, and the breathing
relieved for a brief space; dyspn&#339;a is not a primary symptom
of angina." Eulenburg and Guttmann say, "Our own
experience leads us to adopt Parry's conclusion, that the
changes in the respiration are principally, perhaps even solely,
due to the pain." Bristowe speaks of the sufferer as "fearing
to breathe." We can readily see that the "apnæa" observed
by Dr. Semple in Cases 1 and 5 had physical origin, but in
Case 4 he says "apnæa was extreme; the respiration only occasional&mdash;gasping."
This shows to what an extreme extent
the action of the spider poison had gone&mdash;even to implicating
the diaphragm; and it is noteworthy that Anstie records a
case of angina pectoris (<i>Neuralgia and its Counterfeits</i>, p. 67,
London, 1871), in which "there was so marked a catching of
the breath as to make it almost certain that there was a
diaphragmatic spasm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>Of the changes in respiration accompanying angina pectoris
we have, then, both the general, and the rarest, form,
produced pathogenetically by the poison of <i>Latrodectus
mactans</i>.</p>

<p class="title">IV.</p>

<p>In its physiological action the poison of <i>Latrodectus
mactans</i> resembles angina pectoris vasomotoria&mdash;a purely
functional derangement. The similitude of the physiological
action to pure angina pectoris corroborates the accepted
pathology of the latter condition, because the phenomena of
<i>Latrodectus</i> poisoning were educed from previously healthy
organisms, and in pure angina pectoris there is no pre-existent
organic change occasioning the attack. According to the accepted
pathology, we have in angina pectoris vasomotoria,
sudden spasms of the arterioles; from this an increase of the
arterial tension; to overcome this is more forcible and rapid
action of the heart; as the arteriole spasm persists and doubtless
deepens in intensity, distension of the left ventricle follows,
and from overdistension the agonizing breast-pang, and
even death from stoppage of the heart's diastole. But we
must include another element&mdash;spasm of the coronary vessels.
"When there is a sudden rise in the blood-pressure in the
arteries, due to vasomotor spasm of the peripheral systemic
arterioles, and the heart-walls are strong and well nourished,
palpitation is evoked; when the coronary branches are involved
in the vasomotor spasm then angina is produced, and
the heart-walls, acutely distended with blood, can scarcely
contract in the face of the opposition presented to their contraction
by the high arterial tension. When this sudden
systemic arteriole spasm extends to the coronary vessels in a
heart whose walls are diseased, a fatal attack of angina with
the heart full of blood may be induced. The danger increases
with the extent of the structural degeneration of the heart-walls.
Sudden rises of blood-pressure in the arteries will tax
hearts in their textural integrity, and lead to painful distension;
such sudden demands on decayed hearts lead to agoniz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>ing
angina pectoris, and the sense of impending dissolution is
frequently followed by sudden death."</p>

<p>Spasm of the arterioles and coronary vessels, rise of blood-pressure
in the arteries, embarrassed action of the heart, and
painful distension are just so many consecutive links in the
phenomena produced by the poison of <i>Latrodectus mactans</i>, as
Cases I and IV amply testify.</p>

<p>The spider poisons are akin to the serpent poisons in their
property of producing a disorganization of the blood. In
Case I, thin and florid non-coagulable blood continued to ooze
from the cut surface despite the application of tannin. It
may be a question whether this condition of the blood is
directly toxicological, or a pathological result of stasis in the
peripheral vessels. I incline to regard it as due to the latter
condition, and I believe this explanation also holds good in
the case of serpent poisoning.</p>

<p>The hæmorrhage recorded in Case I was of gastric origin;
splenic congestion existed, and the vasa brevia&mdash;branches of
the splenic artery&mdash;gave way under the pressure. I once
met a similar hæmorrhage in a case of intermittent fever in a
child, and I recorded the fact as a possible hint for the applicability
of <i>Latrodectus mactans</i> in a similar condition.</p>

<p>In all the year that the stray copy of the old magazine was
in my possession I felt it a duty to write up this remedy. I
have done it lamely, but as well as I was able. Reader,
where my duty ends yours begins. May you discharge it
more worthily than I.</p>

<blockquote><p>(There have been a number of cases reported in which <i>Latrodectus mac.</i>
acted as Dr. Jones predicted; from them we select the following by Dr. E.
H. Linnell, <i>North American Journal of Hom&#339;opathy</i>, December, 1890):</p></blockquote>

<p>S. L. G., a man fifty years old, of bilious temperament, a
dentist by profession, had slight attacks of angina after severe
exposure and overexertion during "the blizzard" in March,
1888. He did not consider them of sufficient importance to
consult a physician about them, but some months later he
had a suppurative prostatitis, which was followed by consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>able
prostration, and the attacks of angina became very
severe. I never could get a satisfactory description of the
character of the pain, and I never saw him during a paroxysm.
The pain was brought on by exertion of any kind, and was
especially frequent soon after dinner. The pain was sometimes
felt in the left arm, but was usually confined to the
cardiac region. I once or twice detected a slight aortic obstruction
sound, but aside from this failed to find any evidence
of organic disease. The usual remedies gave no relief, but
<i>Latrodectus</i> &#658;c was of great benefit. Under its use the attacks
gradually became less frequent and less severe. He has taken
no medicine now for at least six months, and he tells me that
although he occasionally has a little reminder of his former
trouble, the attacks are so slight that he pays no attention to
them. I have given the remedy in another similar case,
with even more gratifying success. The attacks were very
promptly arrested and have not returned, although nearly a
year has elapsed. I think we have in this remedy, to which
Dr. S. A. Jones directed attention in one of the issues of the
<i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i>, a very valuable remedy in this painful
affection. It is probably, as Dr. Jones suggests, in angina
pectoris vasomotoria that it will be found especially serviceable.</p>

<h3>LEMNA MINOR.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Lemnaccæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Duckweed.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span> The fresh plant is pounded to a pulp and
macerated in two parts by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following is by Dr. Robert C. Cooper, of London, and appeared in
the <i>Hahnemannian Monthly</i>, 1894):</p></blockquote>

<p>"The lowest form of ph&#339;nogamous vegetation. It consists,"
says Lindley, "of lenticular floating fronds, composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of stem and leaf together and bearing the flowers in slits in
the edge." It forms the green scum found on stagnant ponds
and dykes. It is found in two varieties, the <i>Lemna minor</i>
and the <i>Lemna gibba</i>.</p>

<p>Before going any further I may as well at once make a
bald as well as a bold statement, and say that the special
province of <i>Lemna minor</i> is to pitch with vigor upon the
nostrils; from the very moment I began prescribing it this
was beyond question evident. I can think of no possible
source of error except that this beneficial action may be due
to the germs adhering to the fronds of the <i>Lemna</i> rather than
to the pure plant-force.</p>

<p>To guard against this I have carefully filtered my tincture,
but this has not made the slightest change in its beneficial
influence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case I.</span> Woman aged seventy-four; admission date, September
24, 1892. Nose never clear; breath very unpleasant;
for twelve hours nose bled continuously last Christmas; unable
to smell properly; hearing for the past seven or eight
weeks bad; watch not heard on contact. Prescribed <i>Lemna
minor</i> &#952;A. October 1, 1892: Feeling of cold in nose is better;
sense of obstruction nearly gone; can smell better; hears on
contact on both sides; no medicine. October 22: Decided,
though slight improvement in hearing; nose, throat and all
parts around more comfortable. Last attendance.</p>

<p>In proceeding with the consideration of the action of this
remedy, I must consider myself fortunate in having the following
case to bring forward:</p>

<p>1. A boy of fourteen, whose nose was completely blocked
up for the last two years, and whose nostrils were full of
polypi, the nose itself being broadened, and in whom the nose
had been cleared out by operation a year ago at St. Bartholomew's
Hospital, was sent to me by my colleague, Dr. J. H.
Clarke. The boy never remembers having smelt anything,
and the polypi can easily be seen blocking up both nostrils.</p>

<p>From the 26th of November, 1892, to the 4th of March,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
1893, four doses of <i>Lemna m.</i> &#952;A were given at regular intervals
without much change, then <i>Calcarea carbonica</i> 200 was
given, and two weeks after, as he had faceache, <i>Mercurius</i> 3d
dec., and on the 8th of April following the faceache was
better but the nose in no way improved.</p>

<p>Then <i>Lemna</i> was given again, and this time with the most
pronounced relief; the nose became much clearer, and he
went on taking it, and it alone with scarcely an exception, in
fortnightly doses, till the 14th of March last, when his nose was
quite clear, with none but a very small polypi visible; he
could breathe freely and his sense of smell had completely
returned.</p>

<p>The delay in the manifestation of remedial change from
November to March arose from complete blockage of the nose,
and until the space created by the subsidence in the size of
the polypi sufficed for a passage of air the patient had no
reason to acknowledge relief.</p>

<p>In the treatment, both of swollen tonsils and in that of
nasal polypi, the prescriber will be led away at the onset who
accepts the testimony of the patient alone; he should make
careful inspection of the parts, and be guided by what is often
but a slight local change, as well as by concomitant, and it
may be remote, symptoms.</p>

<p>2. The next case I have to bring forward is one of oz&#339;na
in a girl of sixteen, who had been three years under the treatment
of a colleague who kindly sent her on to me for treatment
at the London Hom&#339;opathic Hospital. The girl, whose
occupation was a teacher, has had oz&#339;na since three or four
years old. The odor complained of was horrid, and the discharge
excessive; a most unpleasant smell in the nose and
nasty taste in the mouth; she takes cold easily if out in the
night air or damp, and her nose, at times, gets stuffed up;
bowels irregular; catamenia only twice&mdash;once three months
ago and two months before that.</p>

<p>On December 30, 1893, I prescribed <i>Lemna minor</i>, and she
returned to me from the country, where she was living, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the 31st of the following March, imploring me for another
powder, as she had been almost well for two weeks after the
last and then had relapsed to her old state; breathing is short
and is low spirited.</p>

<p>21st of April, very much better; odor not nearly so bad,
discharge much less; unmedicated pilules, three times a day.</p>

<p>19th of May, 1894, kept better for a month; took cold two
weeks ago, and since then throat has felt thick and nose has
discharged with a horrid odor. Catamenia regular. Breathing
is better; crusts coming from both, worse on the left side.
To have <i>Lemna minor</i>.</p>

<p>This patient came from a distance which prevented frequent
attendance, but the above is quite sufficient evidence of
the power possessed by <i>Lemna m.</i> in acting upon the nasal
mucous membrane.</p>

<p>In both these cases relief was immediate after the administration
of the dose, and in neither case could any reasonable
doubt exist as to its being drug effect.</p>

<p>In some cases I have known a certain disturbance of the
bowels to set in after a dose of <i>Lemna</i>, but this effect of the
remedy is not sufficiently pronounced to be able to say much
about it. Still it is interesting to narrate one or two experiences,
especially as in the first of these, at all events, the concomitants
were interesting.</p>

<p>3. In a married lady, aged about twenty-six, for whom I
prescribed <i>Lemna m.</i> &#952;A on Saturday afternoon, November
12, 1892, and in whom there existed a good deal of catarrhal
pharyngitis, due to high up post-nasal ulceration, and who
suffered from a dry feeling at the top of the throat with flatulence,
and some pain in the bowels toward the evening,
described as "twisting" pain, and in whom the nose was
blocked on the right side, but without any visible polypus,
and in whom the heart was easily disturbed, causing dyspn&#339;a,
the bowels being slightly confined.</p>

<p>Two weeks subsequently she stated that after the dose of
<i>Lemna</i> the nose felt less blocked, and she felt better in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
respect; but that on the Tuesday following diarrh&#339;a set in,
which began with twisting pains in the bowels and went on
to sickness; continual watery stools. The least chill or nervousness,
I must say, upsets her in this way; and she was subject
to the same the last two catamenial periods. She still
wakes with her throat dry and tongue coated. <i>Borax</i> 2x was
then (November 25) given without any noticeable effect, and
on the 9th of December <i>Lemna minor</i> &#952;A was again prescribed
for the following symptoms:</p>

<p>Mouth sore after talking or singing, and dry in the morning;
tongue coated.</p>

<p>On the 23d of December, reported herself much better;
tongue not so coated; heart less disturbed; no indigestion or
diarrh&#339;a.</p>

<p>Nose not perfectly clear, but no unpleasant smell or taste
as she used to have, and throat no longer dry or uncomfortable.
Instead of waking up with a dirty mouth, it feels clean
and her taste pure.</p>

<p>4. A man, aged forty-seven, who suffered from old-standing
vascular deafness and who specially complained of snoring a
great deal, was given <i>Lemna minor</i>, and next day a rumbling
and disturbance in the bowels set in and he felt as if he had
taken medicine of a searching character. This lasted for
three days, bowels acting during this time freely with much
heat in the passage (anus); but was not bilious, nor were the
motions diarrh&#339;ic; the snoring went away, and he ceased to
dream unpleasantly when asleep. Hearing, too, seemed somewhat
improved.</p>

<p>5. In another case, after a similar dose, diarrh&#339;a came on
next day, with pains across the bowels as from flatus; worse
after eating, and a very putrid taste with an improvement at
the same time in a stuffiness of the nose from which he was
suffering.</p>

<p>6. Crusts form in the right nostril and pain like a string
extends from the right nostril to the ear of the same side and
right ear is deaf. (In a woman, aged twenty-six, great relief.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>It is with great pleasure that I have now to bring forward,
not my own observations, but those of two valued colleagues.
Dr. J. H. Clarke sends me the following:</p>

<p><i>Lemna minor</i>, <span class="smcap">Case I.</span> A lady, aged forty-seven, two years
previously met with an accident; a sign board fell on her
head when out walking in the street. Seven days after that
was taken with sneezing attacks, suffered from nasal catarrh
with little intermission until March, 1893, when she came
under my care. <i>Psorinum</i> 30 soon put a different complexion
on the case, and she became so far relieved of her trouble
(which has made her life almost unbearable, as she never dared
make an appointment for fear of an attack coming on) that
she discontinued treatment. Last Christmas a sharp attack
of influenza brought back the catarrh, and this time it proved
less amenable to treatment.</p>

<p>Fears of polypus distressed the patient, though I could not
discover any.</p>

<p>However, she again made progress, but scarcely as rapid as
I could have wished, when I thought of giving her <i>Lemna</i> on
indications given by Dr. Cooper.</p>

<p>On February 15, 1894, I gave it in the 3x, one tablet four
times a day.</p>

<p>February 22, very much better; has felt freer in the head
than at any time during the last ten years; has felt very
much better generally; spirits braced up.</p>

<p>She steadily progressed to cure, and by March 15th could
endure the smell of strong scented flowers, which before was
impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case II.</span> Captain B., aged forty-four, consulted me on February
29, 1894, for violent neuralgia on the right side of the
neck, the part being exquisitely sensitive to touch. He had
cough and cold for a month. On getting up in the morning
he filled two pocket handkerchiefs with yellow deflusion before
he got his nose clear. I gave him <i>Bell.</i> 12 to take till
the neuralgia was better, and then told him to take <i>Lemna</i>
3x gtt. j. three times a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>On March 9th he reported that the <i>Bell.</i> speedily took away
the neuralgia, and that then the <i>Lemna</i> cleared off the catarrh
in a most astonishing fashion. He never had a medicine to
act so magically before.</p>

<p><i>30 Clarges street, Piccadilly, W., April 21, 1894.</i></p>

<p>The next communication that I have to bring forward is
one from Dr. J. C. Burnett:</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper told me that he had relieved a case of nasal
polypus with <i>Lemna minor</i>, and having several cases of the
kind that had long been under my observation I thought it
my duty to give them the benefit of <i>Lemna</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case I.</span> A gentleman of sixty years of age, with nasal
polypus only moderately developed, yet of many years' duration,
was much troubled by the chronic nasal obstruction
which was markedly worse in wet weather.</p>

<p>I gave him <i>Lemna</i> 3x, five drops in water, night and morning.
Returning in a month, he exclaimed: "That is the
best tonic I have ever taken; I have never taken any medicine
in my life that has done me so much good. I feel quite
comfortable in my nose and can breathe through it quite
well."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case II.</span> A lady, about forty-five years of age, mother of a
large family and whom I had formerly cured of an uterine
tumor, was so troubled with nasal polypi that her life was
very distressful; moreover, the polypi had swelled so much
that they hung out of the nostrils and compelled the patient
to remain within doors. This was notably the case in wet
weather. Why not have them removed chirurgically?</p>

<p>"Oh, I have had them operated on over and over again, but
it's no good; they only come again worse than ever."</p>

<p>I have tried many things to cure these polypi, but in vain;
they would get temporarily better, but the first rainy weather
brought them back worse than ever; hence Dr. Cooper's
recommendation of <i>Lemna</i> is very welcome to me.</p>

<p>I ordered, as in the last case, with the result that the polypi<span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span>
very greatly diminished in size, and the patient could again
take her place in society.</p>

<p>I have used <i>Lemna</i> in many other similar cases, and with
the like result. In no case is the polypus really cured, but
greatly diminished in size, and the patient rendered relatively
comfortable. Clearly the <i>Lemna</i> does not either kill, cure or
otherwise get rid of the polypi, but it rids them of much of
their succulence and thus reduces their volume, and also diminishes
the influence of wet weather to which such patients
are so prone. And this is no small boon; is itself in every way
superior to any operative interference. The tincture I made
use of was made by Dr. Alfred Heath. The first prescription
only being of Dr. Cooper's own make. Both acted alike well.</p>

<p><i>86 Wimpole street, June 4, 1894.</i></p>

<p>From these remarks of Dr. J. H. Clarke and Dr. J. Compton
Burnett, as well as from my own, I think there can be no
doubt, whatever, that the <i>Lemna</i> exercises a powerful influence
upon the Schneiderian mucous membrane. How far it
is capable by its specific action of removing large groups of
polypi remains, as yet, an open question.</p>

<p>My own experience of the treatment of nasal polypi is that
we have very few remedies that can at all be depended upon
for giving even temporary relief. Even from <i>Calcarea carbonica</i>
and <i>Teucrium marum verum</i> I have not had the effects
that some practitioners testify to their possessing.</p>

<p><i>Lemna</i> has so far given relief in my hands to cases of
nasal polypi and to cases where the nostrils were plugged by
swollen turbinates and other causes in a matter far surpassing
the effect I have obtained from any other remedy.</p>

<p>In saying this I do not at all wish it to be understood that
we have in it a specific for all such cases.</p>

<p>We must remember that the symptoms in all such obscure
diseases must be our guide for the selection of our remedy,
and that, therefore, the important point is to work out the
specific indications for the drug as we learn them from clini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>cal
observation, in the hope that on some future occasion
pathogenesis may render these still more certain.</p>

<p>The indications that I myself have noticed as belonging to
<i>Lemna</i> are either a putrid smell in the nose or a loss of all
sense of smell and a putrid taste in the mouth, especially on
rising in the morning, with a general foulness of the mouth,
due apparently to the dropping down of impure material from
the post-nasal region. Along with this there sometimes seems
to prevail a disposition to "noisy diarrh&#339;a."</p>

<p>Dr. Burnett has noticed that <i>Lemna</i> patients have their
nasal symptoms aggravated in damp and rainy weather, and
I have to some extent confirmed this observation.</p>

<p>I hope on some future occasion to return to the subject of
<i>Lemna</i>; it is in every way well worthy of being prosecuted
further.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, a lady patient, æt. fifty-eight, suffering
from pains flitting about her head and legs, with pains in her
eyes during heavy rain, and in whom drowsiness by day and
restless sleep at night existed, had all these symptoms removed
by a single dose of <i>Lemna</i>, and the pallid, dullish,
sickly look in her face changed to a complexion that was natural
and healthy.</p>

<p>The truth would seem to be that <i>Lemna's</i> symptoms are
specially aggravated in heavy rains; <i>Calendula's</i>, when
heavy clouds are about; <i>Rhododendron's</i>, in thunder storms,
and <i>Dulcamara's</i>, in damp surroundings and in foggy
weather.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In 1895 Dr. Thomas L. Shearer contributed the following concerning
the remedy to the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Eye, Ear and Throat Journal</i>):</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lemna minor</i> where the crusts and the muco-purulent discharge
are very abundant with fetor (in rhinitis atrophics).
Its action is wonderful, but it must not be administered in
too low a dilution, as it then produces a sensation of intense
dryness in the pharynx and the larynx. Possibly if it were
exhibited in a much higher dilution it would be applicable to
cases which have only a slight amount of discharge. It seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
best to stop the remedy as soon as its action upon the secretions
is marked, and then to wait a while before returning to
its further employment. Dr. Cooper, of London, was, I believe,
the first to investigate the action of <i>Lemna minor</i> upon
the upper air passages, but I do not think that he had tried
it in cases of atrophic rhinitis. There is a great future for
this new addition to our therapeutic resources, and it certainly
deserves further investigation. It modifies the secretions
to such an extent that we can more readily improve the
condition of the nasal chambers with the aid of local measures.
Whether it has the power to prevent or even retard
the actual process of atrophy remains to be seen.</p>

<h3>LEVICO.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Dilutions made from the mineral water or
triturations from the residue obtained by evaporation of the water.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. Burnett has called the attention of the profession to this water in his
books. The following concerning its constituents is from <i>The Therapist</i>, a
London journal):</p></blockquote>

<p>Of all mineral waters those of Levico are distinguished, not
only by their contents of these three elements, arsenic, iron
and copper, but they are remarkable for the state of combination
in which they occur. Situated in South Tyrol, on the
confines of Italy, Levico has for many years been a favorite
sanitorium of the Italian medical profession for their nervous
and skin patients. Of late years Levico water has also been
increasingly recognized by the German and Austrian faculty,
among whom Bamberger, Billroth, Hebra, Nussbaum, and
others testify to the extraordinary remedial activity of the
waters, favoring assimilation, increasing nutrition, and in
chronic and dyscratic skin diseases functioning as antiseptic
or astringent.</p>

<p>Merely as an internal medication <i>Levico</i> water has, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>ever,
proved so satisfactory that it is a recognized member of
the pharmacop&#339;ia in many German and Austrian hospitals
and clinics. Thus Professor Nussbaum, of Munich, writes
that '<i>Levico</i> water is given in my orthopædic institute in
doses of two or three ounces to scrofulous and anæmic children.
The water is well tolerated, and in spite of the smallness of
the dose the result is, in many cases, very evident.' Professor
Eulenberg, of Berlin, finds <i>Levico</i> water especially satisfactory
in chorea minor in children and at the age of puberty,
as well as for hysterical neuralgia and spasms. A very copious
testimony of like nature has been borne respecting <i>Levico</i>
water.</p>

<p>

<span class="smcap">Preparation</span>.&mdash;Trituration of the dried pea.<br />
</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. W. A. Dewey contributed the following paper concerning this
remedy to the <i>Medical Century</i>, 1899):</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">History and Description of Effects,</span></p>

<p>The <i>Lathyrus</i> is a vetch, and a member of the leguminosæ
family growing in India.</p>

<p>This remedy, which produces a perfect picture of certain
spinal affections, has been known for over a century. In
<i>Christison's Toxicology</i> it is stated that it causes paraplegia,
dragging gait, turning-in of the toes, stiffness and semi-flexion
of the knee-joints.</p>

<p>The attention of the hom&#339;opathic profession was directed
to the drug as a possible remedy in paraplegia, in the
<i>British Journal of Hom&#339;opathy</i>, Vol. III. Here is found an
account of a wheat famine in India, where the peas of the
plant were substituted for wheat and used as a food. Those
who subsisted on it were taken, even during sleep, with<span class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span>
sudden paralysis of the lower limbs; this occurred without
warning, in young men more than in young women, and
was never recovered from. Another observer records fifty
cases who had eaten the <i>Lathyrus</i> bread and all stated that
they became paralytic during the wet season of the country,
that they went to bed quite well and awoke with stiff legs,
unsteady gait, and aching, but no severe pain. The upper
extremities were free.</p>

<p>Another who saw the disease in Algeria and described the
symptoms found in ten cases observed that they came on suddenly,
in damp weather, with some pains in the loins, trembling,
motor paralysis and exaggerated reflexes. He attributed
these phenomena to an acute transverse myelitis with degenerative
changes in the cord.</p>

<p>A German writer states that the drug produces disturbances
of nutrition of the muscles of the lower extremities, paresis,
and that the muscles of the trunk and neck and face remain
unaffected. Sensation remains normal. It seems to produce
a sclerosis of the pyramidal tracts of the cord.</p>

<p>In animals the same condition is found; namely, paralysis
of the hind legs. Pigs drag their hind legs and horses give
out.</p>

<p class="center">AGGRAVATED SYMPTOMATOLOGY.</p>

<p>From all the sources which I have been able to find, the
following seem to be the symptoms caused by the drug:</p>

<p>Sudden loss of power in the lower extremities, from the
waist down.</p>

<p>Tremulous, tottering gait.</p>

<p>Great exaggeration of the reflexes.</p>

<p>Stiffness and lameness of the ankles and knees.</p>

<p>Excessive rigidity of the legs; flexion difficult; spastic
gait, the legs becoming interlocked, and walking is difficult
or impossible.</p>

<p>Sudden onset of the trouble, and apparent aggravation in
cold and damp weather.</p>

<p>Emaciation of the gluteal muscles also observed.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Those having taken it walked on the metatarso-phalangeal
articulation, the heel not touching the ground.</p>

<p>Impossible to stand steady; swayed from side to side, but
closing the eyes had no effect. This with the exaggerated
reflexes would exclude its use in locomotor ataxia.</p>

<p>Debility and tremors of the legs.</p>

<p>Rigidity of the adductors of the thighs.</p>

<p>Staggering gait, with eyes fixed on the floor.</p>

<p>Could not extend or cross the legs when sitting.</p>

<p>Sensibility unimpaired.</p>


<p class="center">CORRESPONDENCE TO SPINAL DISORDERS.</p>

<p>From these symptoms it will be seen that the effects of the
drug correspond to many spinal symptoms, but more especially
to what is known as spastic paraplegia. Indeed,
Struempel asserts that it produces a perfect picture of this
disease.</p>

<p>It is not so often that such a perfect picture of a disease
can be had as in this instance. The disease itself is easily
recognized by the stiff, spastic gait; the spasm of the adductors,
causing the knees to strike each other, or to become
locked, causing the patient to fall; the shuffling of the feet;
the excessive muscular rigidity and the other well-known
symptoms of paraplegia.</p>

<p>Therefore, reasoning from our law we would expect the
drug to be of service in such cases, and although our pathogenesis
of it is coarse we may be permitted to apply it to a
disease whose symptomatology is of the coarse order; for it
is often difficult to elicit any fine and characteristic symptoms
in diseases like ataxic and spastic paraplegia.</p>

<p>It has been recognized as a remedy by but few of our writers
on nervous diseases. O'Connor finds that marked benefit follows
its use in old cases of myelitis with marked spastic symptoms.
Bartlett, in <i>Goodno's Practice</i>, recommends it in excessive
knee-jerk and rigidity. Hart speaks of it as a remedy
in locomotor ataxia, but the absence of sensory symptoms and
the presence of exaggerated reflexes would seem to contra-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>indicate
it in this disease. He also speaks of it in spinal
anemia, giving as symptoms: "Numbness, followed by pain
in the lower extremities; sensation of a band around the
body; unable to step or distinguish one limb from another"&mdash;symptoms
which I am unable to find that the remedy produced.
Elliott also speaks of it.</p>

<p class="center">CLINICAL RÉSUMÉ.</p>

<p>The clinical record of <i>Lathyrus</i>, though very meagre, gives
great hope that it may prove useful in numerous cases of bed-ridden
paraplegiacs and in infantile spinal paralysis, as well
as in certain forms of myelitis.</p>

<p>The following is a résumé of all that I can find published:</p>

<p>I. Case of spinal paraplegia, relieved.</p>

<p>II. A case of multiple sclerosis in a young man of twenty-eight
who had been ill seven years and unable to walk for six
years was greatly benefited by <i>Lathyrus</i> &#658;x.</p>

<p>III. Case of paraplegia, could walk after taking the remedy
for some time.</p>

<p>IV. Case of paraplegia, no improvement.</p>

<p>V. Rheumatic paralysis, with stiff knees, could walk after
use of <i>Lathyrus</i>. (Clark <i>Hom&#339;opathic World</i>.)</p>

<p>VI. In a case of a clerk with loss of power of the lower
limbs, reflexes exaggerated, knee-jerk violent, locomotion
difficult and unsteady, probably a case of transverse myelitis,
<i>Lathyrus</i> &#658;x, night and morning, gave most satisfactory
results. The patient could walk a mile without assistance.
(Simpson, <i>Hom&#339;opathic Review</i>.)</p>

<p>VII. In a man aged fifty-two who had been unable to walk
for six years, the paraplegia coming on after a "stroke" from
exposure to wet, <i>Lathyrus</i> &#658;x practically cured in eight
months. He had been tied to a chair for six, and at the time
he stopped treatment he was walking four miles daily. (Blake,
<i>Hom&#339;opathic Review</i>.)</p>

<p>From the fact that the <i>Lathyrus</i> disease occurs frequently
in certain mountainous regions of Asia it has been remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
that it is akin to Beri-Beri, which has been traced to eating
the <i>Lathyrus</i> bread.</p>

<h3>LIATRIS SPICATA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Compositæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Common Names</span>, Dense Button-Snake-root. Gay Feather.
Devil's Bit.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The root is pounded to a pulp and macerated
in two parts by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following, by Dr. T. C. Duncan, was called forth by the publication
of an item in <i>Eclectic Medical Journal</i>, stating that twice during the past
year <i>Liatris</i> had given good results in dropsy; in one case, on the second
day, the patient had passed a gallon and a half of urine. Dr. Duncan's
paper was published in the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i> for 1898):</p></blockquote>

<p>Any new remedy that promises relief in dropsy will be
hailed with pleasure by the profession. Happening into a
pharmacy soon after receiving the January <i>Recorder</i>, a physician
rushed in and inquired for "that new remedy for dropsy&mdash;that
got rid of 'a gallon and a half of urine in one day.'
Have a bad case cardiac dropsy. Want to try it. How do you
give it?" He could not get it. "Get me some," was his
order. "There is the article, be sure to get the right thing,
<i>Liatris</i>!"</p>

<p><i>Liatris spicata</i> is the familiar "button-snake-root" that I
used to dig every fall for our old family physician (who called
himself a "botanic physician") and who gave it for indigestion.
It is also called "colic root" and "devil's bit," because a
piece is missing from each tuber as a rule, just as if bitten
out. <i>Kost's Medicine</i> (my first medical work) describes it as
follows: "Root perennial, tuberous, ovate, abrupt, beset
around the base with many fine fibers; it is aromatic. Stem
round, about three feet high, bearing a spike of scaly purple-colored
blossoms, bearing in the aggregate a resemblance to
an acorn. The leaves are linear or sword-shaped, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
resembling the leaves of young corn. It is found in prairies
and open woods in the western States."</p>

<p>"The <i>Liatris</i> is an aromatic stimulant, diaphoretic, diuretic,
anodyne and carminitive. It is particularly useful in colic,
backache and flatulency."</p>

<p>It is interesting to know that it has had clinically a good
effect in dropsy, (1) due to liver and splenic enlargement, also (2)
where the kidneys were involved. In the second case referred
to, "<i>Apocynum can.</i>, <i>Aralia</i>, <i>Digitalis</i>, <i>et al.</i>" had been given,
but the kidneys failed to respond until the <i>Liatris</i> "was given
in infusion," then "on the <i>second</i> day the patient passed <i>a
gallon and a half of urine</i>"&mdash;equal to 192 ounces of urine!
In the first case the <i>Liatris</i> was followed by <i>Ferrum carb</i>.</p>

<p>Whether it will prove equally efficient in cardiac dropsy
only time will tell. I hope that the readers of the <i>Recorder</i>
will report results, whether favorable or otherwise. The dose
that Dr. Bradley gave was about a pint, drank during the
course of the day, containing about half an ounce of the root.
The tincture will be more convenient, and it is a question if
the dilutions will not be equally efficient. Try the third,
and then go up or down the scale as the case seems to demand.
This drug should be proved. It is harmless. If any young
physician will volunteer I will gladly direct him.</p>

<p>Infusion of <i>Digitalis</i> (English leaves) is a favorite prescription
with some physicians in cases of cardiac dropsy, but I
have not found that form any more efficient than the dilution,
except in cases where alcohol had been a cause, then <i>Strophanthus</i>
or <i>Arsenicum</i> had a better effect.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following concerning this little used drug was reported by Dr. Bonino,
an Italian physician, translated by Dr. Mossa and published in the <i>Allgemeine
Hom. Zeitung</i>, July, 1898. The use of the drug by Dr. Bonino was
truly hom&#339;opathic for the short proving of it. Allen's <i>Encyclopædia</i> reports
trembling of the limbs and hand so great that "he could not hold a glass of
water.")</p></blockquote>

<p>A carpenter, aged twenty-nine years, had been suffering
ever since his eighteenth year of trembling in both hands,
especially in the morning; of late also his legs began to
tremble. It is remarkable that both his father and his brother
were subject to the same ailment, while no definite cause could
be indicated. He was first given <i>Mercurius vivus</i>, then
<i>Agaricus</i>, which brought a partial but only transitory improvement.
Finally I prescribed <i>Lolium tem.</i>, which in a
short time effected a cure.</p>

<blockquote><p>(On this Dr. Mossa comments as follows):</p></blockquote>

<p>The pathogenetic effects of this remedy which has not yet
been proved at all are only known to some degree from its effects
when it has been mixed with grain and baked into bread.
It has caused chest troubles, <i>vertigo</i> (thence the name darnel-grass,
in German <i>Taumellolch</i>), <i>trembling</i>, paralysis with
anguish and distress, vomiting, failing of the memory, blindness,
headache, epileptic attacks, deep sleep and insanity.
The good success obtained by its use in the case given above
shows what curative effects may be expected from it in severe
affections of the brain or spinal marrow. An Italian physician,
Fantoni, has tried it in cephalalgia, meningitis rheumatica
and in ischias.</p>

<p><i>Lycopus Virginicus</i> seems to be a specific for bringing back
an old (but long disappeared) hæmorrhoidal flux in persons
with light eyes. I gave, a week ago, the first decimal dilution
to a gentleman (sixty years) for noise and throbbing in
the head during the night (which prevented the quietness of
sleep); because neither <i>Cactus</i> (which helped quickly when
he had blood-spitting) nor <i>Kalmia</i>, nor <i>Gelsemium</i> helped
radically. The night after taking <i>Lycopus</i>, he was a little
better, and in the forenoon came a bleeding from the rectum
(about three tablespoonfuls after defecation) with great general
relief. There was chronic catarrhus bronchialis. Two
days afterwards, I gave an elderly lady (sixty years), who had
glycosuria, cataract of the left eye, and every third night was
very restless, <i>Lycopus Virginicus</i> 1 decimal dilution, one drop
in the evening. The following night was excellent, and in
the morning came an abundant bleeding from the rectum,
with great relief. Both patients are tall, very irritable, have
weak innervation of the heart, without decided organic disease
of the heart; both are hypochondriacs; have light eyes;
noise in the left ear. Both had, years ago, hæmorrhoidal
flux, which stopped suddenly.</p>

<h3>MALARIA OFFICINALIS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;It is prepared in three degrees of strength:<br />

No. II. Is the water that decomposed vegetable matter for two

No. III. Is the water that decomposed vegetable matter for

<blockquote><p>(The following is an abstract of a paper on this peculiar remedy, by Dr.
G. W. Bowen, that appeared in the Transactions of the Indiana Institute of
Hom&#339;opathy, 1895):</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span>In the summer of 1862 vegetable matter of different forms
was decomposed in my office in glass jars, and malaria was
freely generated. Persons were hired to inhale the gas evolved
in its different stages of decomposition, and a careful observation
of its effects on them was made that gave me a clue to its
future use, and the only reliable guide for combatting its effect
when acquired naturally.</p>

<p>Not only did the gaseous form demonstrate, but subsequent
use of the liquid product proved it capable of producing not
only the three leading types that the past years had made me
conversant with, but also others of a minor grade yet of unsuspected
parentage.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 28em;">
<span class="i0">The miser made delight of added gain,</span>
<span class="i0">Was like a pebble on the shore again,</span>
</div>

<p>In comparison to the satisfactory consolation that came as a
realization of the comprehension of the producing cause.
Henceforth the battle need not be carried on mid the gloom
of the night.</p>

<p>The decomposition of the vegetable matter passed through
three stages or degrees. The first gave off gases freely, yet
of not so offensive odor as later. After ten days or two weeks
the expense of securing inhalers was more than doubled, even
for one moment of time. After three or four weeks not much
gas was generated, for it seemed only capable of lying still
and sending its fearful odor heavenward. Inhalation of the
gases evolved produced for the first week or ten days a headache,
nausea, distress in the stomach, coated the tongue white,
and this in from one to two hours time generally; and there,
if not carried too far, would generally pass off in two or three
days. Inhalations after ten days or two weeks did not produce
results in less than twelve or twenty-four hours, according
to time and amount inhaled. Then there was fearful
headache, nausea, aversion to food, distress through the hypochondriac
region, first in the spleen, the liver and stomach, and
on the third day chills that would doubtless have continued
on indefinitely if not interfered with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>After decomposition had gone on for three or four weeks
it was ascetic and simply fetid to a fearful degree, and no
results except nausea were apparent in any one exposed to it
in less than three or four days. The first was extreme lassitude
and loss of appetite, and apparently a continued fever,
with an unlimited amount of pains and aches and a lassitude
that limited locomotion.</p>

<p>Three vials of the watery tincture were saved, one each
from the various stages of decomposition, and from these an
attempt was made to make provings and find out what were
the reliable antidotes to them, and thus be able to cope with
my invisible foe in my daily avocation. Their provings were
not carried far enough, or continued long enough to be justified
in placing them in our Materia Medica, but are ample to
aid and guide the future steps that ought to be taken. Its
discontinuance was rendered rather necessary by my enthusiasm
that led too far in a few cases, but the antidotal effects of
certain remedies amply compensated me for my financial and
reputational loss.</p>

<p>Bilious colic, nausea, cramps, diarrh&#339;a and headaches
were readily secured from a few drops of the first vial, in many
cases, while the second vial gave me a large number of cases
where the liver, spleen, stomach and kidneys were apparently
seriously involved, and not them alone, but fair types of intermittent
fever with its attendant shakes, some daily, some
tertian.</p>

<p>With the third vial trouble came, as it did reduce many
that had been able to be up and around to their beds, and unmistakably
cause them to get worse, and cause them to degenerate
into a typhoidal or semi-paralytic condition. In a
few cases I was deprived the liberty of finding my antidotes
and helping them out of the dilemma.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Among the experiments made with these strange tinctures, if they may
be so called, was the following, which is strangely confirmatory of a speculation
advanced by several old physicians that consumptives are benefited,
or even cured, by being exposed to malaria):</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>It was a lady, the last of a family of five, all others had
died of consumption, and three in her preceding generation
of the same disease. I doubted the probability of saving her,
yet <i>theoretically</i> decided that as the primitive action of malaria
was, first, the spleen, next the liver and stomach, that I would
develop an artificial or drug disease there, in hopes that her
chest would be relieved and doubtless be benefited. She was
given the tincture from second vial, and on the fifth day she
had a fairly perceptible chill, and a harder one the sixth and
seventh. On the eighth I saw her shake for one hour, and her
fever lasted over six hours. Out of pity my drug was neutralized
and her health was restored, with no more cough distress
in her lungs or heart. She was cured of her tendency and
certainty of dying with consumption. She remained well for
twelve years when she was lost to my call.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In his search for remedies, or antidotes, for the malarial poisons, Dr.
Bowen was disappointed in <i>Eupatorium perf.</i> In his experience the following
remedies are best):</p></blockquote>

<p>For the first or primitive effects, the remedies that did act
most promptly and effectually were <i>Nux vomica</i> and <i>Bryonia</i>,
thus calling to mind the effect of those remedies that experience
had led me to use in the attacks that come in the summer,
that are usually designated as of a bilious nature.</p>

<p>In the secondary form, or where my malaria seemed to be
the result of the decomposition of the material or vegetable
fiber, its effects were more permeating, as different symptoms
were developed by it. Then a change of remedies (or chemical
antidotes, if you please), became necessary, and far the
best results were secured by the use of <i>Bryonia</i> and <i>Arsenicum</i>.
<i>China</i> did not act well or give any reasonable satisfaction.</p>

<p>Prior and later experience give ample satisfactory proof
of the utility of the use of <i>Arsenicum</i> in all types of an intermittent
nature, yet not to discredit the fact that other
remedies can and will cure this form. But that a pernicious
case can, or will, be as readily restored by any other remedy,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span>
I reserve to myself the liberty to doubt. Opportunities and
time have demonstrated that these two remedies are able
to restore the system and remedy a majority of the diseases
that are wont to make their advent in the early autumn or late
in the spring.</p>

<p>Later, after the total decomposition of my vegetable matter
had taken place, and it almost seemed to possess a demoniacal
potency or power to undermine the humblest human form,
then to my surprise <i>Bryonia</i> seemed to hold prestige and
give splendid results, but needed a different assistant, one that
could and would permeate the muscular system, yet slowly,
and for this <i>Rhus tox</i> was called into requisition, and from
that day to this it has not been the means of causing me a
single disappointment.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Again, and as a last quotation from this interesting paper, we quote):</p></blockquote>

<p>Many years of observation have demonstrated one more
important fact in relation to the means that will render the
system less liable to its absorption, at least to that extent that
it will give evidence of its presence, and that is, by the liberal
use of coffee.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In 1897 Dr. Bowen sent the following to the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i> concerning
<i>Malaria off.</i>):</p></blockquote>

<p>Messrs. Boericke &amp; Tafel prepared me a new supply of it,

<p>No. III is the <i>water</i> that decomposed vegetable matter for

decomposed the vegetable fibres.</p>

two, three or four hours apart.</p>

scarcely walk or get into a buggy for two years, from the
effects of rheumatism in her back and limbs. I gave her last
March two drams of No. 30 pills medicated with the first
decimal, or No. 2 preparation, with orders to take ten pills
three or four times a day. In <i>one week</i> she could walk as well
as ever and has no rheumatism or lameness since.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case II.</span> Mr. S., foreman in a large saw mill, has been
afflicted with rheumatism for years. He came to me in April
with a stiff neck and his right arm and shoulder helpless and
painful. He wished me to keep it from his chest and
heart. I gave him two drams No. 30 pellets, first decimal,
and a vial of <i>neutral</i> globules, with orders to take two hours
apart, changing, when better, three hours apart. In three
days he was better and could turn his neck and use his arm
fairly well. One week later gave him two drams more of
<i>Malaria</i>, to be taken six hours apart. He has not had any
rheumatic troubles since that time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case III.</span> Mr. C., proprietor of two large saw mills, one in
Arkansas, where he passes part of his time (and frequently
gets wet), has been afflicted with what some doctors called
gout. I found it was of a rheumatic nature (caused from
malaria) and made worse by <i>Quinine</i> and external applications.
I gave him <i>Malaria</i>, two drams, No. 30 pills. In three
days he assured me he was better and did not have half as
many pains or aches. He took only four drachms, at from three
to six hours apart, and has not had any rheumatic or gouty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
pains since. I saw him last week and he says he is fully ten
years younger than he was last spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case IV.</span> I was called to see I. S., aged 55, a veteran and
pensioner of the last war. He was poor and bronzed in color.
Had not been able to walk for years. After repairing his
heart, chest, stomach and curing his piles and regulating his
bowels he was content, yet he could not walk. Being assured
that his back had been injured while in the army, and as his
limbs would not move at his will and he could not walk alone
or get out of a chair, I gave him for a week <i>Ruta graveolens</i>
and <i>Rhus tox.</i>, of each the first cent., three hours apart. This
enabled him to get up and down two steps alone to the
kitchen. Then, concluding his trouble was due to rheumatism,
and that was caused by malaria, I gave him two drams
of No. 30 pellets of No. 2 form of <i>Malaria</i>, first decimal,
with orders to take ten pills three or four times a day. In one
week he rode to my house and came up and down steps alone.
I gave him two drams more and in five days he came to my
office, having walked nearly three miles that morning alone.
I need not say I was deeply surprised and could hardly believe
it was all due to <i>Malaria</i>. It certainly was, as nothing
else was taken or applied. He has gained flesh and seems to
be at least ten years younger than he was.</p>

<p>These are a few of the surprising results that have been
obtained from <i>Malaria</i> this year. I much wish that others
would try it and help to obtain its proper place as a medicine
and healer when used where it should be given.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. W. A. Yingling contributed the following to the same journal):</p></blockquote>

<p>On the day I received from Boericke &amp; Tafel <i>Malaria off.</i>
30, I was foolishly led to try Hahnemann's inhalation. The
thought just occurred to me on the spur of the moment, and
without stopping to think I took three strong inhalations,
with both sorrow and a proving resulting. None of the
symptoms were distressing, yet marked and clear cut. The<span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span>
remedy commenced its work very promptly and in the order
following:</p>

<p>Aching in both elbows.</p>

<p>A kind of slight concentration of feeling at root of nose,
and just above, as though I should have a severe cold, similar
to that complained of by hay-fever patients.</p>

<p>Aching in the wrists.</p>

<p>A tired ache in the hands.</p>

<p>A tired ache in the knees, and for a distance above and
below.</p>

<p>A feeling as though I should become dizzy.</p>

<p>Pain in top of left instep.</p>

<p>A tired feeling in wrists.</p>

<p>Aching in an old (cured) bunion on left foot.</p>

<p>Sensation on point of tongue as though a few specks of
spice or pepper were there.</p>

<p>Itching on right cheek over molar bone; ameliorated by
slight rubbing or scratching.</p>

<p>When leaning face on left hand, elbow on the table, perceptible
feeling of the heart beats through upper body and
neck.</p>

<p>Slight itching on various parts of the face and extremities;
ameliorated by slight rubbing.</p>

<p>Sense of heat in the abdomen.</p>

<p>Chilly sensation in left forearm. Soon followed by chilly
feeling in hands and fingers; feet are cold with sensation as
if chilliness was about to creep up the legs. A few moments
later knees feel cold. A sense of coldness ascending over
body from the legs.</p>

<p>Arms feel tired.</p>

<p>Belching several times, easy; no taste.</p>

<p>A drawing pain in right external ear.</p>

<p>Lumbar back feels tired as though it would ache.</p>

<p>Neck feels tired, with slight cracking in upper part on
moving the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span>Shallow breathing which seems from languor, with a desire
to take a deep inspiration occasionally.</p>

<p>A kind of tired feeling through abdomen and chest.</p>

<p>A general sense of weariness.</p>

<p>A feeling about head as though I would become dizzy.</p>

<p>Pain in upper left teeth.</p>

<p>A sensation as though I would have a very loose stool
(passed away without a stool).</p>

<p>Feeling rather stupid and sleepy.</p>

<p>A sensation in the spleen as though it would ache.</p>

<p>Saliva more profuse than usual; keeps me swallowing
often.</p>

<p>Pain in abdomen to right of navel.</p>

<p>Dull aching through forehead.</p>

<p>Face feels warm as if flushed, also head; becomes general
over body, as if feverish.</p>

<p>Aching across upper sacral region.</p>

<p>Legs very weary from short walk.</p>

<p>Pain at upper part of right ilium.</p>

<p>General sense of weariness from a very short walk, especially
through pelvis, sacral region and upper thighs. I feel
strongly inclined to lie down and rest.</p>

<p>Qualmishness at stomach, as though I should become nauseated.</p>

<p>General sense of malaise and weariness becoming quite
marked.</p>

<p>Aching above inner angle of right eye.</p>

<p>A kind of simmering all through the body.</p>

<p>Felt impelled to lie down, and on falling to sleep a sense of
waving dizziness passes all over me, preventing sleep.</p>

<p>At times I feel as though I should become cold or have a
chill, then I feel as though I should become feverish or hot,
though neither is very marked.</p>

<p>Eyes feel heavy and sleepy.</p>

<p>Uneasiness in lower abdomen.</p>

<p>Gaping, yawning and desire to stretch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>Legs are restless; feel like stretching and moving them.</p>

<p>I feel very much as I did one time before having the ague,
twenty-five years ago.</p>

<p>Odor from cooking is pleasing, but I have no desire for dinner.
Yet when I sit down I eat a good dinner with relish.</p>

<p>Dizziness on rising from a reclining position.</p>

<p>Feel generally better after eating dinner.</p>

<p>Aching in the occiput.</p>

<p>During the afternoon leg weary.</p>

<p>Unusual hearty appetite for supper (the good appetite keeps
with me for some days).</p>

<p>A good night's rest following, and have felt much brighter
and generally better ever since the first day. (Healing.)</p>

<p>I have no doubt had I repeated the inhalations several times
I should have been very sick. It is not necessary to push a
proving to extremes. I think Hahnemann did not as a rule.
If I were strong I should push this proving, but I dare not.
Who will take it up?</p>

<blockquote><p>(Apropos of the foregoing Dr. G. Hering, of England, made the following
suggestions which hint at a possible use of the remedy in tuberculosis):</p></blockquote>

<p>What curious discoveries are made by the observant! Witness
the following remarks of Dr. Casanova, as recorded in
the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Review</i> of over thirty years ago:</p>

<p>"I know several localities in South America, Africa and
Spain where the marsh miasma has unquestionably arrested
and cured that fatal scourge of the human race, phthisis pulmonalis,
without any other treatment or restriction in food
or drink. And why should not the climate of the fen lands
of Lincolnshire, in the neighborhood of Spalding, prove as
curative an agent for this disease as the climate of so many
foreign regions where patients go and die, deprived of all the
comforts of a home? Penzance, among the British localities,
is reported to be superior to nine-tenths of the places to which
patients are sent. Penzance, then, and Spalding should be
particularly studied by medical men and recommended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
consumptive individuals who wish to enjoy the benefits and
advantages of a national place of relief, if not of cure."</p>

<p>Upon reading this I began to reflect upon the limitless
nature of science. We never seem to find either beginning
or end to it. Circles within circles, and no one can tell what
communications there are between those circles. We cannot
trace them. We are lost in infinity.</p>

<p>Miasmatic places are the most healthy places&mdash;for some of
us at least.</p>

<p>Now, I think of it, I find I can give some support to this
statement of Dr. Casanova. I was once on board a Liverpool
steamer which put into Aspinwall, on the swampy Isthmus
of Panama, for nine days. Upon our return home several of
the sailors, otherwise healthy fellows, were prostrated by
what was called Panama fever, whilst I myself, who had
formerly suffered from tubercular disease of the lungs, was
totally unaffected.</p>

<h3>MULLEIN OIL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Fill a bottle with the blossoms from the
Verbascum thapsus, cork tight, and hang in the sun for four or
five weeks. By that time there will be an oily liquid distilled.
Mix with ten per cent. of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. A. M. Cushing introduced this now rather well-known remedy to the
medical profession in 1884. He writes of it as follows):</p></blockquote>

<p>The history of it is this: My father's house was the home
for all poor tramps, as well as ministers, etc. He fell into the
river, got water in his ears and was quite deaf for months.
A blind man called, heard loud conversation, asked the cause,
etc., then said for kindness received he would tell us how to
make something that would surely cure him, and it was worth
a thousand dollars in New York city. We made the oil, put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
it in his ears at night, and he was well in the morning. For
years we kept a bottle of it, and it travelled all around the
towns and did wonders. That was when I was a youngster.
When I studied medicine, or when I was practicing, I wanted
to know if it was hom&#339;opathic, and made a proving, and developed
the symptoms of almost constant but slight involuntary
urination, keeping my pants wet.</p>

<p>I did not make any this past season, and have divided till
I have but a little, half-and-half alcohol, left. I could spare a
little of that, and next season, if I live, will try and make a
quantity.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The next item is from a letter of Dr. H. C. Houghton's, of New York,
addressed to Boericke &amp; Tafel.)</p></blockquote>

<p>I have been much interested in the clinical study of this
remedy&mdash;new, yet not new&mdash;but I have not succeeded in
demonstrating what the symptom&mdash;deafness means in this case.
Dr. Cushing does not claim to be an expert in this department,
so time must help us out, and I am anxious to learn all
I can of its effects on the ear.</p>

<p>In an old note-book of Dr. Hering's, <i>Hearing and Ears</i>,
copied for me with the author's permission by my friend Dr.
C. R. Norton, I noticed the following: "In Germany, flowers
of Verbascum thapsus put in a dark-colored bottle, hung up
in the sunlight, give in two or three weeks an oily fluid which
has cured many old people and children." This method is
impracticable, the amount produced being so small. Verbascum
prepared in olive oil or fluid petroleum has the same effect as
any oil; excellent in chronic disease of the integument;
negative in middle ear disease. When your house brought
out <i>Mullein oil</i> under Dr. Cushing's direction, I took it up
again, and have prescribed it in a large number of cases. In
chronic dermatitis of the external meatus and drum-head, or
exfoliation after furuncle, it is excellent; in chronic catarrhal
inflammation of the tympanum I have not been able to see
any effect, but in chronic suppurative disease of the tympanum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
or in accumulations of detritus in cases of perforation, scarred
drum-heads, etc., it acts to dislodge accumulations, free the
ossicula from pressure, and thereby improves the hearing;
this process goes on for months till the tympanum has thrown
out an amount of <i>débris</i> that is surprising. In a few cases it
has caused soreness and increased muco-purulent discharge,
due, I think, to excessive use.</p>

<p>My experience with it in chronic catarrh of the tympanum
coincides with that of my friend, H. P. Bellows, M. D., of
Boston, as published by him, but I purpose to continue the
study of the drug, and hope for better results. In sub-acute
or chronic disease after suppuration its effect is very gratifying;
it aids exfoliation and checks irritation from exfoliated
material.</p>

<p>I am able to confirm the symptoms noted of its effects in
nocturnal enuresis in many instances. There is one effect I
have not seen noticed by any observers: relief of night cough.
More than ten years ago, Dr. H. A. Tucker, Brooklyn, N. Y.,
told me of a <i>Glycerole of Mullein</i> made by macerating the
plant in Jamaica rum for two or three weeks, expressing it
and adding to this product an equal quantity of glycerine.
This led me to the use of the fluid extract of the plant,
glycerine and water, equal parts, as a mollifier in cases where
patients would resort to some popular remedy containing
opium or similar opiate. The same effect can be produced
by drop doses of <i>Mullein oil</i>, the teasing cough which comes
on lying down, preventing the sleep usually yielding to a few
doses.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. J. C. Wentz contributed the following bit of folk-lore):</p></blockquote>

<p>The application of <i>Mullein oil</i> is of more general application
than anything I have found in print. I report to you
some cases:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case I.</span>&mdash;Mertie B., aged sixteen. Called to see her May
20, 1888. Found her suffering great pain in right ear.
Parotid gland very much enlarged and painful. The right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
side of the head and face much swollen. Pulse about 100;
tongue coated.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;<i>Mullein oil</i> in the ear, and used as a liniment
twice daily on the swollen parts. For the fever, <i>Aconite</i>.
Great improvement during the first twenty-four hours, and on
the 23d found the case convalescent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case II.</span>&mdash;Carrie H., aged twenty-two. Her second child
four weeks old. Called November 15, 1888. Right breast
inflamed and sore. Two weeks previous it had been lanced by
another physician, a little above the nipple, but now a place
a little below and to the left of the nipple gives evidence of
forming pus. I told her that in my judgment it had gone too
far to check it then.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;<i>Mullein oil</i>, one-half ounce in four ounces of
water. Wet cloths and apply. The inflammation and soreness
disappeared in one week, and by the use of the same
remedy occasionally has entirely recovered without breaking.
Her husband, when he paid me, said: "Well you have done
better than any of the rest of the doctors."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case III.</span>&mdash;Linford S., aged sixty-four. Called to see him
September 20, 1888. Has just recovered from typhoid fever,
but is able to be around. Taken with inflammation of the
right testicle. Swollen to the size of a goose egg, and much
pain. Red and shining appearance of the skin. Cause unknown,
unless it was in connection with chronic enlargement
of prostate gland.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;<i>Mullein oil</i> applied twice daily as a liniment.
<i>Mercurius sol.</i> internally. In three days the soreness and
pain had entirely disappeared, but the enlargement continued
several days. He walked around with ease three or four days
before swelling had diminished any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case IV.</span>&mdash;F. C., aged thirty. Called November 16, 1888.
Found inflammation of left kidney and of left testicle. Had
been under treatment by another doctor and had recovered
partially, but relapsed. Suffering much with pain in testicle,
which ran up the spermatic cord and through to the left
kidney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;<i>Cantharis</i> and <i>Aconite</i>, as there was some
fever. <i>Mullein oil</i> applied to the testicle. Rapid improvement
during the first twenty-four hours, and made a quick recovery.</p>

<p>I have also cured a case of chronic inflammation of the
eyes, and a case of chilblains from which the patient had suffered,
during the winter, for about six years. * * *</p>

<p>Every drug has its exact range. This one being new to
the profession, we are just learning what it will do. In all
these cases the <i>Mullein oil</i> has had an outward application
twice daily.</p>

<p>A short time ago I was in Dodge city and was talking with
a friend about the use of various remedies in veterinary practice,
and amongst them I mentioned an almost instant cure
of earache in a boy and also the same in a cat by the use of
<i>Mullein oil</i>. He said: "Why do you hom&#339;opaths use that?
I used to have the well sweep full of bottles of mullein blossoms
when I was a boy. We used the oil as a dressing for
burns, and it was the best thing we could get." He also related
to me the following case, which is of interest and may
prove of great value: An old neighbor, a Mr. Kemmis, had
spent a large amount of money treating with various physicians
for what they pronounced a rose cancer and without any
relief. An Indian squaw told him to use <i>Mullein oil</i>. He
distilled it (as it is now prepared, by sun exposure), and for a
short time bathed the cancer with the oil. The growth of
the cancer was permanently checked, but was not healed.
Mr. K. lived, perhaps, forty years after the treatment was
used, and the cancer never again bothered him.</p>

<h3>MUCUNA URENS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Leguminosæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Horse-eye.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The pulverized bean is macerated in five times
its weight of alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>
<blockquote><p>(Delgado Palacios, of Venezuela, in 1897, wrote Messrs. Boericke &amp; Tafel
concerning this remedy):</p></blockquote>

<p>Reading the list of remedies of your "Physicians' Price
Current," I was very much astonished to meet with the name
<i>Dolichos pruriens</i>, which the greater and modern authorities
in botanical matters consider an identical plant with <i>Mucuna
urens</i>.</p>

<p>You will meet the botanical description of <i>Mucuna urens</i>
and <i>altissima</i> (two varieties) in the Flora of West Indian
Islands, by A. H. R. Grisebach, p. 198 (Grisebach regards
<i>Mucuna</i> and <i>Dolichos</i> as two different genus).</p>

<p>If one consider that there is a discussion upon this subject,
and on the other hand that the mother tincture you possess is
that which is made with the hair on the epidermis of the pod
(<i>North American Journal of Hom&#339;opathy, vol. 1, p. 209.</i>
<i>Allgemeine Hom&#339;opathische Zeitung, vol. 53, p. 135.</i> <i>Oehme,
Hale's Amerikanische Heilmittel, p. 242</i>), while the tincture
which we employ is made with the pulverized bean (1:5 alcohol)
enclosed in the pod of a special plant which grows in the
calid regions of Venezuela I believe you must try the same
tincture we use and the success will be that which we obtain.</p>

<p>I have used my tincture of <i>Mucuna urens</i> extensively in a
great number of hæmorrhoids and with the most satisfactory
results. It seems that the characteristic symptom or key-note
is a sensation of burning. The hæmorrhoids may be or not
in a great stage of development, there may be more or less
blood, etc.</p>

<p>One can consider the <i>Mucuna urens</i> as a specific against
the hæmorrhoidal diathesis. The diseases of other organs,
depending upon that cause, liver, uterus (hæmorrhage) and
intestinal affections, yield admirably to its use.</p>

<p>I have been treating recently a remarkable case of chronic
ingurgitation of a testicle, small and frequent hæmaturias,
and other intestinal troubles with a prominent symptom, the
hæmorrhoidal state, which led me to use <i>Mucuna</i>, and in a
few months I have obtained a perfect success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>The experiences have taught me, and I have the conviction
that this tincture is a more perfect remedy for the cure
of hæmorrhoids than any other remedy known. I rely upon
it more faithfully than I do upon <i>Hamamelis, Æsculus</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Its pathogenetics are not known.</p>

<p>I frequently use the mother tincture in the hæmorrhoids,
one drop daily. I seldom use the lower dilutions. <i>Mucuna</i>
may be used also, and with success, as an ointment.</p>

<p>The beans are very difficult to obtain; the plant has a single
yearly crop.</p>

<h3>NAPHTHALIN.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin</span>&mdash;A chemical compound procured from coal, alcohol,
ether vapor, etc.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Trituration of the pure naphthalin.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Two clinical cases illustrating the use of <i>Naphthalin</i>. The first is by Dr.
W. L. Hartman, in Transaction of the Hom&#339;opathic Medical Society of New
York, 1896.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In treating children we are often disappointed in our results;
in making prescriptions we think we have just the right
thing in the right place, but when we come to see our case
again we are confronted with the same condition that we had
before. We may say the same in adults, but not so often.
In whooping cough in the very young who are unable to tell
us how they feel we must rely on what the mother may tell
us; but how often do we find mothers who cannot tell their
own symptoms, let alone those of their children? Now, what
do we do? Sit and look wise and guess at our prescriptions
while we hear the little fellow coughing, in fact trying to
cough his head off and at the same time lose his breath.</p>

<p>Well, now while you are thinking and looking wise in
this case, just think of <i>Naphthalin</i> and give a tablet triturate<span class="pagenum">[Pg 222]</span>
of the 1x every two hours, and when you are consulted the
next time you will not be annoyed with the dreadful choking
spell. Now in prescribing this remedy it is not necessary
to wait until the child chokes to death with the cough,
but give it from the first and you will be surprised how it
will cut the disease short. I do not know as I have ever
given this remedy without receiving benefit, and in many
cases it was unnecessary to give any other remedy to cure the
case; if it is, <i>Drosera</i> will follow best.</p>

<p>The grand characteristic of this remedy is long and continued
paroxysms of coughing, unable to get a respiration,
sometimes so violent as to cause perspiration.</p>

<p>This remedy is not only good in whooping cough, but in
any condition where you get the above symptoms <i>Naphthalin</i>
will cure your case just the same. Now my experience with
this remedy where I have prescribed above the 1x has been
very unsatisfactory, so, of late, I only use the one potency.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The other by Dr. W. A. Weaver in <i>Hahnemannian Monthly</i>, 1898.)</p></blockquote>

<p>My experience with <i>Naphthalin</i> in whooping cough is as
yet limited, but the results obtained have very much exceeded
other remedies and I wish to cite a few cases in which the
alleviation of the symptoms was soon appreciable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case I.</span>&mdash;Francis&mdash;&mdash;, a boy of 9 months, with a severe
bronchitis as a complication. The breathing was labored.
The respiratory murmur was feeble and a large number of
sibilant and sonorous râles were heard, when I was called to
see the case. The child had become emaciated, had a cyanotic
appearance, was unable to retain food for any length of time,
because of the frequent paroxysms accompanied by vomiting,
and was very much exhausted. Later, the moist râles became
very prominent over the entire chest. The paroxysms
were of great length, and accompanying was a free discharge
of thick, tenacious mucus from the nose and mouth. Many
of the favorite remedies employed in this disease were prescribed,
but with little effect. <i>Naphthalin</i> was then given,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
four or five drops of the tincture in one-half glass of water.
In a short time the paroxysms were lessened in severity and
frequency, the expectoration was freer, the number of râles
were lessened, and shortly convalescence was well established.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case II.</span>&mdash;John&mdash;&mdash;, 3-1/2 years, with an accompanying
bronchitis. Symptoms worse at night. Paroxysms very long
and severe; would hold his head to relieve the pain from
coughing. Great difficulty experienced in breathing. A
number of râles heard over portion of the chest, with little
expectoration. After <i>Naphthalin</i> had been given for a short

complications.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case III.</span>&mdash;Patrick&mdash;&mdash;, a man 23 years of age, large
physique and healthy appearance, contracted pertussis from
other members of the family, and, although not accompanied
by the whoop, the paroxysms were very severe. They were
not frequent during the day but many during the night. He
would wake the entire house by coughing and would become
purple in the face. He had been suffering a week or two
before I saw him. I prescribed <i>Drosera</i>, <i>Corrallium rub.</i>,
<i>Ipecac</i> and <i>Hyoscyamus</i>, without appreciable improvement.
He gradually grew worse until <i>Naphthalin</i> 1x in pellets was
given. The spasmodic condition was relieved very shortly,
and although the cough remained for a short time it never
became severe and soon entirely disappeared.</p>

<h3>NARCISSUS.</h3>

<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Daffodil.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The young buds, stems and leaves are macerated
in two times their weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following is from the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i> for May, 1899):</p></blockquote>

<p>"Agricola," one of the <i>Hom&#339;opathic World's</i> oldest con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>tributors,
has the following to say of this very old, yet little
known, remedy. After stating how he prepared it, he continues
as follows:</p>

<p>"A case of bronchitis (a <i>continuous</i> cough) has from <i>Narcissus</i>
1-3x obtained such <i>prompt</i> marked relief, where a most
varied selection of the standard remedies had hitherto failed,
as to induce me to write these few lines in hope that as this
beautiful flower is about to be found in most cottage gardens
the prevalent bronchitis, whooping and other coughs may
meet with prompt cures. Dr. Chargé's work, <i>Maladies de la
Respiration</i>, quotes the great Laennec, M. D., as an authority
<i>in re Narcissus</i>."</p>

<p>There is no proving whatever of this drug, although in the
<i>Encyclopædia</i> (Allen) a case of poisoning from the bulbs eaten
as a salad is given; but the remedy as prescribed by Agricola
was prepared from the young buds, stems and leaves, so the
case in the <i>Encyclopædia</i> is not apropos, nor is the old tincture
from the bulbs of use.</p>

<p>The name of the plant, <i>Narcissus</i>, is not from that of the
fabled youth who fell in love with his own image reflected in
the water, but is from the Greek <i>Narkao</i>, "to be numb," on
account of the narcotic properties of the drug. The classic
Asphodel and the Narcissus are the same, from which it may
be seen that the plant dates back as far as man's records go.
Fernie, in his excellent <i>Herbal Simples</i>, from which we gather
the preceding, also says: "An extract of the bulbs applied to
open wounds has produced staggering numbness of the whole
nervous system and paralysis of the heart. Socrates called
this plant the 'Chaplet of the Infernal Gods,' because of its
narcotic effects."</p>

<p>Fernie also says that a decoction of the dried flowers is
emetic, and when sweetened will, as an emetic, serve most
usefully for relieving the congestive bronchial catarrh of children.
"Agricola's" experience, quoted above, however, seems
to disprove the notion that the beneficial action in bronchial
catarrh is the result of the emetic properties of the drug, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
demonstrates rather that it is peculiarly hom&#339;opathic to this
malady and long-continued coughs, especially of nervous
origin, as may be inferred from the following, the concluding
paragraph in Fernie's section on the <i>Narcissus</i>:</p>

<p>"The medicinal influence of the Daffodil on the nervous
system has led to giving its flowers and its bulb for hysterical
affections, and even epilepsy, with benefit."</p>

<p>The <i>National Dispensatory</i> says practically the same, <i>i.e.</i>,
"The emetic action of <i>Narcissus</i> has been used to break up
intermittent fever and relieve bronchial catarrh with congestion
or obstruction of the air tubes. Like <i>Ipecacuanha</i>, it has
also been prescribed in dysentery, especially of the epidemic
form. Its influence upon the nervous system, is attested by
the vogue it has enjoyed in hysteria, chorea, whooping cough
and even epilepsy."</p>

<p>It is still the emetic action that is looked to here, but any
good hom&#339;opath will see beyond that, in Agricola's experience,
and perceive a strong hom&#339;opathic action in the drug
to the conditions named, for if it were the emetic action only
that is efficacious then, certainly, one emetic would do as well
as another, but there is something more, and the curative
action can be obtained from hom&#339;opathic doses without the
emetic action. The tincture should not be prepared from the
bulb, as has been the case in the past, but from the fresh
buds and leaves. From such a preparation considerable benefit
in obstinate bronchial coughs should be confidently expected.</p>

<h3>NEGUNDO.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Sapindaceæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The bark of the root is macerated in twice its
weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In the <i>California Medical Journal</i>, 1898, Dr. O. S. Laws, of Los Angeles,
California, writes of a new "pile" remedy, <i>Negundo</i>):</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>I suggested that we have a "Symposium," in Our Journal,
on single remedies. They are the backbone of whatever science
there is in therapeutics, and should be kept in view. As a
starter I offer one that is entirely new to the medical fraternity,
as I cannot find it in any medical work.</p>

<p>In botanical language it is known as Negundium Americanum.
The common name is "box elder." It is a native of
Kansas. It is a distant relative of the Acer family. I had
just fairly begun to test its value when I left Kansas for California,
and not finding it here, except as a shade tree on the
sidewalks, I cannot get any of the root bark, which is the
part used. From the short experience I had with it I conclude
it is the best internal remedy we have for hemorrhoids.
I have used <i>Colinsonia</i> and <i>Æsculus</i> without ever being impressed
with their prompt action. But <i>Negundo</i> goes at it
as <i>Colocynth</i> does in its specialty, so that the victim who has
been writhing with an engorged rectum "will arise up and
call you blessed." So you see this is not only a single remedy,
but a "fundamental" one. The bark of the root in the yearling
plants is what I prefer.</p>

<p>Recent cases of hemorrhoids can be completely cured in
this way, and the old hard cases temporarily relieved. So,
gentlemen of the medical profession, I hereby introduce to
you my friend <i>Negundo</i>.</p>

<h3>ONOSMODIUM VIRGINIANUM.</h3>

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The entire plant with root is macerated in

<blockquote><p>(This paper was prepared by Dr. W. A. Vingling for the Kansas State
Hom&#339;opathic Society, and reprinted in <i>Hom&#339;opathic Physician</i> for July,
1893).</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 227]</span>To the hom&#339;opathic physician a new remedy, well proven,
is an acquisition of greater importance than honor or wealth,
for his sole duty being to relieve the sufferings of humanity,
he acquires a new tool with which to accomplish his work.
To the degree that the new remedy has peculiar characteristics
its value is enhanced, to the extent that the pathogenetic effects
are different from every other drug its usefulness becomes
the more apparent. Generalities constitute a poor basis
upon which to prescribe. Peculiarities, the unusual symptoms,
give certainly an assurance in every prescription.</p>

<p>We have in <i>Onosmodium</i> a remedy with some peculiarities,
and occupying a sphere unique, a curative range differing
from that of every other drug. The remedy holds within its
grasp the power to restore peace to the disrupted family, and
to prevent the truant husband seeking the sweets of "stolen
waters" by restoring the wife to the enjoyable performance of
her wifely functions, and thus gratifying the dissatisfied husband.
This generation of one-child families, Malthusian,
with the long train of misery entailed upon the licensed family,
adultery consequent upon preventive measures, <i>malum in se</i>,
has its remedy in <i>Onosmodium</i> to a very large extent.</p>

<p>We pass to consider the more important pathogenesis of the
remedy in regular course. A great part of this paper is necessarily
based upon the notes of the original author, Dr. W. E.
Green, with some isolated symptoms from the journals and
my own experience.</p>

<p>We find marked in the mental sphere a <span class="smcap">drowsiness of
mind</span> and <span class="smcap">confusion of thought</span>, <span class="smcap">dulness of intelligence</span>,
a <span class="smcap">dazed</span> feeling of the mind. The party wants to
think and not move, so absorbed in thought as to forget all
else and where she is. There is a <i>complete listlessness and
apathy</i> of the mind; she cannot <i>concentrate</i> her thoughts.
From this want of concentration there follows an impairment
of the memory, <i>she cannot remember what is said</i>. In conversation
she will forget the subject, will begin a new one,
and then suddenly change to another. There is great <i>confusion<span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span>
of ideas</i>. This listlessness is so great as to cause forgetfulness
of what one is reading, or that one is reading at all: the
book drops in vague and listless thought. The time passes
too slowly, and minutes seem like hours. There is great
irritability of temper.</p>

<p>There is a continuous and ever-present feeling of heaviness
of the head. <span class="smcap">Pains in the left side of the head</span> and
<i>over the left eye</i>, extending round the left side to the back of
the head and neck, greatly aggravated by moving or jarring.
Intense pain driving her to bed; relieved by sleep, but soon
returning after waking. There is a constant dull headache,
chiefly centered over the left eye and in the left temple;
always worse in the dark and when lying down. Here we
have a contradictory symptom&mdash;always worse lying down.
The general symptoms are ameliorated by lying down. This
peculiar feature is also seen in some of the polycrests.
<i>Bryonia alb.</i> has a "pain and pressure in the shoulder when
at rest." <i>Rhus tox.</i> has a "stiff neck, with painful tension
when moving;" <i>Arsenicum alb.</i> has a headache relieved by
cold water.</p>

<p><i>Onosmodium</i> has a <span class="smcap">dull, heavy pain in the</span> occiput
pressing upward <span class="smcap">with a dizzy sensation</span>. Pain changing
from the right frontal eminence to the left and remaining
there. Darting and throbbing in the left temple. A dull
pain in the mastoid process. She cannot bear to move. A
sense of fullness in the head. Relieved by eating and sleep.</p>

<p>The eyes are <span class="smcap">heavy and dull</span>; the eyes feel as though
one had lost a great deal of sleep. The lids are heavy. The
eyeballs have a <i>dull, heavy pain with soreness</i>. A sensation
of the eyes being very wide open, with a desire to look at
distinct objects, it being disagreeable to look at near objects.
Distant objects look very large. <i>Picric acid</i> patients can only
see clearly at very close range, often at only five inches from
the eye; <i>Natrum sulph.</i> has impairment of vision for distant
objects. With <i>Onosmodium</i> the ocular muscles feel tense,
tired, and drawn. Pains in and over left eye. Pain in upper<span class="pagenum">[Pg 229]</span>
portion of left orbit, with a feeling of expansion. The vision
is impaired and blurred.</p>

<p>The hearing is impaired. There is a stuffed-full feeling in
the ears as after catching cold. Singing in the ears as from
quinine, but very slight.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">nose feels dry</span>. There is a stuffed feeling in the
posterior nares. The discharge from the posterior nose is
whitish and sticky, producing a constant hawking. Constant
sneezing in the morning; sneezing when first getting up.
The bones of the nose pain.</p>

<p>Flushed face, with relief from headache. That dry feeling
of the nose is also present in the mouth and lips. Bitter,
clammy taste in the mouth. Saliva is very scant, with the
dry feeling in the mouth; cold water relieves. Sore throat. It
hurts to swallow or speak. That dryness follows down the
<i>throat</i> and <i>pharynx</i>, and is accompanied with <i>severe soreness</i>.
Raw, scraping feeling in the throat. When swallowing the
pharynx feels constricted. All the throat symptoms are relieved
by cold drinks and by eating. The voice is husky.
The chest feels sore.</p>

<p>Morning sickness like that of pregnancy. Distaste for water,
yet there is a <i>craving for ice water and cold drinks</i>; <i>wants to
drink often</i>. The abdomen <i>feels bloated</i> and distended, which
is relieved by undressing. The pains in the lower part of the
abdomen are also relieved by undressing or by lying on the
back. This amelioration from undressing is observed to run
through all the symptoms of the drug. A constant feeling as
though diarrh&#339;a would come on.</p>

<p>The stools are yellow, mushy, or greenish-yellow, stringy,
mushy, with tenesmus. Also, slimy, bloody, stringy stool,
with tenesmus. The provers were hurried out of bed in the
morning to stool.</p>

<p>The urine is scanty, highly colored, dark straw and brown,
very acid, and of high specific gravity. The desire is seldom,
or else frequent, with scanty flow.</p>

<p>In regard to the sexual organs we quote from that racy<span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span>
writer, Dr. S. A. Jones, who says: "<i>Onosmodium Virginianum</i>
in its primary action seems directly opposite to <i>Picric acid</i>.
Perhaps provings of it with smaller doses will oblige me to
change this <i>dictum</i>. If they do not, then <i>Onosmodium</i> will
occupy the singular position of a remedy that <i>primarily depresses
the sexual appetite</i>. If this should ultimately prove
to be the case, it will invest this remedy with an unmistakable
significance to physicians who are practicing at the <i>tail
end</i> of the nineteenth century, for, from our habits of life, it
is the <i>end</i> that is showing signs of distress. In estimating
the validity of this suggestion, the reader will bear in mind
Hahnemann's <i>dictum</i> that <i>only the primary symptoms of a
drug afford the indications for its therapeutical application</i>.
This is a canon of Hahnemannian Hom&#339;opathy, and it <i>is
true as regards the infinitesimal dose</i>. Then, this being true
(for I will not stop to discuss it), <i>Picric acid</i> will be indicated
for the <i>initial stage</i> of sexual debility and <i>Onosmodium</i> for the
<i>fully developed consequences</i> of sexual abuse; and this, because
the said 'initial stage' is characterized by erethism
while the ulterior consequences are denoted by atony asthenia.
The erethism of sexual debility is plainly evinced in <i>Picric
acid</i>, and the ultimate asthenia is as really discovered in
<i>Onosmodium Virginianum</i>."</p>

<p>In the male we find diminished sexual desire. Cold feeling
in the glans penis. Nocturnal emissions. Too speedy emissions.
Deficient erections with diminished pleasure.</p>

<p>In the female we find <span class="smcap">severe uterine pains</span>. <span class="smcap">Bearing-down
pains in the uterine region.</span> Uterine cramps.
<i>Soreness in region of uterus</i>, increased by <i>pressure</i> of the hand
or of the clothing; had to remove the corset. Return of old
uterine pains. Dull, heavy aching, and slowly pulsating pains
in the ovaries. Pains pass from one ovary to the other and
leave a soreness which remains till the pain returns. Ovarian
pains increased by pressure. <span class="smcap">Sexual desire completely
destroyed.</span> This symptom I have verified a number of
times, and in every case the parties prevented conception. The<span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]</span>
uterine pains are all better when undressed or lying on the
back. Constant feeling as though the menses would appear.
Menses early and profuse, but otherwise normal so far as
known. Leucorrh&#339;a light yellowish, slightly offensive and
excoriating; profuse, running down the legs. Itching of the
vulva aggravated by scratching and from the leucorrh&#339;al discharge.
Aching in both breasts, but worse in the left. Breasts
feel swollen and engorged. Left breast feels bruised and
painful on pressure. Nipples itch. In one case where this
remedy was given for dryness of the nose and throat, the diminutive
almost absent, breasts were restored to their pristine
glory, and resulted in the displacement of the cotton batting
pads to the exceeding joy and delight of the proud woman.</p>

<p><i>Pains in the neck</i>, running back from the forehead. <i>Dull
aching in the neck.</i> Bearing down pain in the lumbar region.
Dull, aching pain in the lumbar region. In the female
provers there was produced a pain over the crest of the left
ilium. <span class="smcap">Tired, weary and numb feeling in the legs and
popliteal spaces. Feeling of numbness, mostly below
the knees.</span> The legs feel as if they were partially anæsthetized.
The tendons and joints of the knees have a dull, aching
pain. Tremulousness of the legs. <span class="smcap">Disturbance of the
gait in walking, with a sense of insecurity in step.</span>
<span class="smcap">Staggering gait</span>, <i>he cannot keep in the walk</i>. The sidewalks
seem too high; he must step high which jars him and
greatly aggravates the headache. Dull, heavy pain in the
instep of the left foot. Numb, tingling pain in the outer side
of both little toes. <span class="smcap">The legs feel tired</span>, <i>as though they
would not sustain the weight of the body</i>. Sensation of formication
in the calves of the legs. Ankles swollen.</p>

<p><i>Pain in the left scapular region</i>, confined to a small spot.
<i>Fluoric acid</i> and <i>Lilium tig.</i> have pain confined to a small spot
in any location, while <i>Oxalic acid</i> has a pain confined to small
longitudinal spots. <i>Magnesia phos.</i> has a sharp burning pain,
about an inch in diameter, under the border of the left scapula,
as from a hot iron (see also <i>Phos.</i>); with <i>Onosmodium</i> there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
dull, aching pain in the biceps muscle, also a pain of like nature
in the elbow joint and wrists. <i>The arms and hands feel
tired and weak</i>; they tremble. Inability to co-ordinate the
muscular movements of the arms. Pain in the phalangeal
articulation.</p>

<p>The aggravations are generally from motion or jarring;
from pressure or tightness of clothing.</p>

<p>The ameliorations are peculiar and marked. Better when
quiet, <i>when lying down on the back</i>, <i>when undressed</i>, when in
the open air, from sleep, <i>from cold drinks</i>, <i>from eating</i>.</p>

<p>In the generalities we find great <span class="smcap">muscular weakness or
prostration and tired feeling over the entire body</span>.
A feeling as though one had just gotten up from a severe spell
of sickness. Nervous trembling as if from hunger. The least
exertion produces a tremulousness. <i>The muscles feel treacherous
and unsteady as though one did not dare to trust them.</i> A
desire to change position without any definite cause or reason,
and without any change for the better or worse. Later in the
proving there was a desire to lie down and be quiet, with a
drowsy, sleepy feeling. <i>A sensation as if a chill would come
on</i>; a tired, aching, stretching, gaping, disagreeable feeling.
All sensations are worse in the left side.</p>

<p>In my own experience I have used the remedy from the
mother tincture up. I got no results from the tincture.
Hardly any from the 30th, but a marked, decided, and very
rapid action from the CM. I use nothing lower than the
CM, and prefer the higher.</p>

<blockquote><p>(A treatise on the "Sexual Passion," by the late Dr. Gallavardin, Lyons,
France, contains this item on <i>Origanum</i>):</p></blockquote>

<p>The person who discovered a remedy that in a certain
sense may be considered as a specific against sexual passion
was a clergyman of Mizza, the founder of an orphan asylum.
This remedy is <i>Origanum majorana</i> (or common marjoram),
which proves effective in masturbation and in excessively-aroused
sexual impulses. The author uses it in the 4th dilution,
as he has not found the higher potencies effective. He
dissolves five or six globules of this dilution in four teaspoonfuls
of fresh water, and the young masturbator takes of this
every two days, a quarter of an hour before the meal, one
teaspoonful. If the cure is not accomplished eight days after
this solution is used up, the same dose is repeated in the same
way. When desired, this remedy can be used, according to
the author, without the knowledge of the patient, by pouring
a teaspoonful into the soup, milk or chocolate.</p>

<p>The effect frequently appears very rapidly, but sometimes
it does not appear.</p>

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The whole plant without the root is macerated

<blockquote><p>(The following proving of the "loco weed" was conducted by the late
Dr. W. S. Gee, of Chicago, in 1887):</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Oxytropis Lamberti</span>, Pursh.&mdash;<i>Commonly taller, as well
as larger</i>, than other varieties (the scapes often a foot or more
high); silky,&mdash;and mostly silvery-pubescent, sometimes
glabrate in age; leaflets from oblong-lanceolate to linear (4
to 16 inches long); <i>spike, sometimes short-oblong and densely
flowered</i>, at least when young; <i>often elongated and sparsely<span class="pagenum">[Pg 234]</span>
flowered</i>; <i>flowers mostly large</i> (often an inch long, but sometimes
much smaller), variously colored; pod, either narrowly
or broadly oblong, <i>sericeous pubescent</i>, <i>firm-coriaceous</i>, half-inch
or more long, <i>imperfectly two-celled</i>. Includes <i>O.
Campestris</i> of Hook, Fl. Bor. Am., in part. Common along
the Great Plains from Saskatchewan and Minnesota to New
Mexico, Texas, etc., and in the foot-hills.&mdash;From Coulter's
<i>Manual of the Botany of the Rocky Mountain Region</i>.</p>

<p>It is one of the poisonous members of that family. It is
found in California and New Mexico.</p>

<p>It is a perennial plant, with herbaceous or slightly shrubby
stems, the foliage remaining green during winter when grass
is scarce, and so attracting animals that would otherwise
probably instinctively shun it. The plants do not appear to
be equally poisonous at all seasons or in all localities, and it
has been doubted whether the active properties they possess
are due to a normal constituent of the plant. No medical
use has ever been made of these plants, although their poisonous
character has often led to the suggestion that they
might be found valuable. No physiological study has been
made of the action of the poison, and no complete chemical
analysis has as yet appeared.</p>

<p>The stockmen speak of it as causing intoxication in the
animals which eat it, and a prominent symptom is the
"loco" condition, in which the power of co-ordination is lost
or greatly limited. They cannot readily readjust for changes
in gait, etc. A horse travels on level ground, but finds great
difficulty in changing to pass over an elevation or depression,
or, when going up hill, he has great difficulty in starting
down hill; it is difficult, when he is still, to impress him that
he must go, and as difficult to stop him when desired. The
same rule applies to eating and other necessaries. Such a
horse is said to be "locoed." Professor Hawkes procured
specimens from which Boericke &amp; Tafel made a tincture.
To further test the merits of the remedy, the students of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span>
class at Hahnemann Medical College of Chicago kindly participated
in a proving.</p>

<p>Professor Hawkes received some reports from his group,
but has mislaid his papers, and he is unable to give in detail
the symptoms produced. He stated, however, that the principal
action corroborated that given above.</p>

<p>During 1886-'87 term I made another attempt, and a few
reports were received. The remedy was given by number,
that the prover should not know what he took, nor the
strength of it. Some were given the &#952;, others 1x<span class="num">d</span>&nbsp;, 2x<span class="num">d</span>&nbsp;, 3x<span class="num">d</span>&nbsp;,

<blockquote><p>(Dr. W. D. Gentry, while at Las Vegas, New Mexico, made the following
summary of the action of the remedy. <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i>, 1895):</p></blockquote>

<p>For the present I will only give a few of the leading symptoms
produced by the <i>Loco weed</i>:</p>

<p>Brain and Mind: Stimulation of mind; pleasant intoxicated
feeling. Satisfied indifference to all influences and interests.</p>

<p>Head: Full, warm feeling about the head.</p>

<p>Eyes: Strange feeling of fullness about the eyes, with
sight obscured, so that it appears that one is looking through
clear water which produces about all of the seven prismatic
colors, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and violet.</p>

<p>Paralysis of nerves, and muscles of the eyes, producing
amblyopia. Pupils contracted and do not respond to light.</p>

<p>Eyesight lost with feeling as if in consequence of long exposure
to strong, arc-electric lights.</p>

<p>Neck and Back: Numb, pithy or woody feeling about and
in the spine.</p>

<p>Lower Extremities: Loss of power to control movements of
body or limbs.</p>

<p>Swaying, staggering gait.</p>

<p>Reflex action of tendon-patella lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>General: Weakness and insecurity of all powers of locomotion.</p>

<p>Feeling of intoxication, with almost entire loss of vision.</p>

<p>Amblyopia: sense of touch greatly weakened.</p>

<blockquote><p>(From the <i>Kansas City Star</i>.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The loco weed of the Western plains is to vegetation what
the rattlesnake is to animal life. The name comes from the
Spanish and signifies insanity. It is a dusky green and
grows in small bunches or handfuls and scatters itself in a
sparse and meagre way about the country. It is in short a
vegetable nomad and travels about not a little. Localities
where it this season flourishes in abundance may not see any
of it next year, nor indeed for a number of years to come.</p>

<p>The prime property of the loco is to induce insanity in
men or animals who partake of it. Animals&mdash;mules, horses,
sheep and cattle&mdash;avoid it naturally, and under ordinary circumstances
never touch it. But in the winter, when an inch
or two of snow has covered the grass, these green bunches of
loco standing clear and above the snow are tempting bits to
animals which are going about half starved at the best.
Even then it is not common for them to eat it. Still, some
do and it at once creates an appetite in the victim similar in
its intense force to the alcohol habit in mankind.</p>

<p>Once started on the downward path of loco a mule will
abandon all other forms of food and look for it. In a short
time its effects become perfectly apparent. You will see a
locoed mule standing out on the shadowless plain with not a
living, moving thing in his vicinity. His head is drooping
and his eyes are half closed. On the instant he will kick
and thresh out his heels in the most warlike way. Under
the influence of loco he sees himself surrounded by multitudes
of threatening ghosts and is repelling them.</p>

<p>The mind of the animal is completely gone. He cannot
be driven or worked because of his utter lack of reason. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
will go right or left or turn around in the harness in spite of
bits or whip, or will fail to start or stop, and all in a vacant,
idiotic way devoid of malice. The victim becomes as thin
physically as mentally, and after retrograding four or five
months at last dies, the most complete wreck on record.
Many gruesome tales are furnished of cruel Spanish and
Mexican ladies who, in a jealous fit, have locoed their American
admirers through the medium of loco tea. Two or
three cases in kind are reported in the Texas lunatic asylum.</p>

<h3>&#338;NANTHE CROCATA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The fresh root is macerated in two parts by
weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following paper on <i>&#338;nanthe crocata</i> was kindly sent to the editor
by Dr. W. A. Dewey, of the Ann Arbor University, Michigan):</p></blockquote>

<p><i>&#338;nanthe crocata</i> belongs to the large family of the Umbelliferæ
which furnishes us with <i>Conium</i> and <i>Cicuta</i>. It grows
in marshy localities in England and France. In Botanical
works of the 16th and 17th centuries it was often confounded
with <i>Cicuta virosa</i>, an error which has even been made in
more recent times, in fact, only one Botanist of the 19th century
described the plant with sufficient exactness for its recognition,
and that was DeLobel, who published his Botany in
1851. It is one of the largest plants of the family, being 3 to
5 feet high. Our tincture is from the fresh root.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Historical.</span>&mdash;<i>&#338;nanthe</i> was known to Galen and Dioscorides,
and numerous citations might be made to show that
the drug was used from the earliest times in various affections,
affections that nearly every drug was tried in, but it is in the
"Cyanosura Materia Medica of Boecler, published in 1729,"
that we first find a hint as to its true action. "Those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
ate much of it were taken with dark vertigos, going from one
place to another, swaying, frightened, turning in a circle as
Lobilus pretends to have seen."</p>

<p>Hahnemann, in his "Apotheker Lexicon" (Leipzig, 1793),
says of the drug: "It is said that the whole plant is poisonous
and causes vertigo, stupefaction, loss of force, convulsions,
delirium, stiffness, insensibility, falling of the hair, and taken
in large quantities will cause death."</p>

<p>He says further: "That, administered with great circumspection,
it should prove useful in certain varieties of delirium,
vertigos and cramps."</p>

<p>This is interesting coming from Hahnemann at the time
when he had discovered the law, but had not as yet given it
to the world.</p>

<p><i>&#338;nanthe</i> was considered in the last century as one of the
most pernicious plants of Europe, especially for cattle, who,
having eaten it, can neither vomit nor digest it and they soon
die in convulsions; this from the root, however, as they eat
the leaves with impunity. It is interesting to note that animals
poisoned with it decompose rapidly.</p>

<p>Much of the following study is taken from a series of excellent
papers on the drug, which have been appearing for
over a year in "Le Journal Belge D'Hom&#339;opathie," from
the pen of Dr. Ch. DeMoor, of Alost, Belgium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Action.</span>&mdash;From a very large collection of observations
of cases of poisoning with <i>&#338;nanthe</i>, dating from
1556 to the present time and recorded in "Allen's Encyclopædia,"
the "Cyclopædia of Drug Pathogenesy," and in the
article of Dr. DeMoor, above mentioned, we find that <i>&#338;nanthe
crocata</i> produces, almost invariably, convulsions of an
epileptiform character and which are marked by the following
symptoms:</p>

<p>Swollen, livid face, sometimes pale.</p>

<p>Frothing at mouth.</p>

<p>Contraction of chest and oppressed breathing.</p>

<p>Dilated pupils or irregular. Eyeballs turned upward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>Coldness of the extremities.</p>

<p>Pulse weak.</p>

<p>Convulsions are especially severe, at first tonic then clonic.</p>

<p>Locked jaws.</p>

<p>Trembling and twitching of muscles.</p>

<p><i>&#338;nanthe</i> also produces a delirium in which the patient
becomes as if drunken, there is stupefaction, obscuration of
vision and fainting.</p>

<p>The Greek name of the plant signifies "wine flower," and
so-called on account of its producing a condition similar to
wine drunkenness, and there is a difference, so I have heard,
between wine and other beverages in this respect. Hiccoughs
are also produced by the drug.</p>

<p>There is also great heat in the throat and stomach and a
desire to vomit and to have stool, and a great deal of weakness
of the limbs and cardialgia. Like other members of the
same family, as <i>Conium</i>, it produces very much vertigo, this
has always been present in the cases of poisoning with the
plant. In a number of cases who had been poisoned by the
drug the hair and nails fell out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hom&#339;opathic Action and Applicability.</span>&mdash;The uses
of <i>&#338;nanthe</i>, hom&#339;opathically, have been taken from the
reports above mentioned; the drug has never been proved, and
it is doubtful if one could be found who would prove it to the
convulsion-producing extremity. All the evidence in all the
authorities shows clearly that the drug produces in man all
the symptoms of epilepsy, and it is in that disease that clinical
testimony is gradually accumulating. Accepting the
theory that epilepsy is a disturbance or irritation in the cortex
of the brain, it would seem that <i>&#338;nanthe crocata</i>, which produces
congestion of the pia mater, would prove a close pathological
simillimum to epilepsy. Its usefulness in this disease
is unmistakable and only another proof of the truth of the
hom&#339;opathic law.</p>

<p>Let us review briefly some of the evidence of its action:
Dr. S. H. Talcott, in the report of the Middletown Asylum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
1893, notes that <i>&#338;nanthe</i> possesses a marked power in
epilepsy, stating that it makes the attack less frequent, less
violent and improves the mental state of the patient. He
prescribes it in the tincture, 1 to 6 drops daily.</p>

<p>In the Materia Medica Society of New York its use has
been verified several times. Dr. Paige greatly benefited a
case with the 3x potency.</p>

<p>Dr. F. H. Fisk reports the cure of a case which had lasted
two years, with the tincture. This case during the last month
before the doctor took it was having from 6 to 10 attacks
daily.</p>

<p>Dr. Garrison, of Easton, Pa., reports a case of reflex uterine
or hystero-epilepsy in which the 2x acted promptly.</p>

<p>Allen in his Hand-Book mentions the cure of three cases
with the remedy.</p>

<p>Dr. J. Ritchie Horner reports that the remedy greatly
modified the attacks in a lady who had had the disease over
20 years, and who, for the two months previous, had had a
convulsion daily. He used the 3x.</p>

<p>Dr. J. S. Cooper, of Chillicothe, Ohio, reports the cure of a
case of 25 years' standing with the 4x.</p>

<p>Dr. Henderson reports the cure of a case of 9 years' standing,
where the patient was almost idiotic; the convulsions were relieved
and the mental condition was greatly relieved and improved.
In two other cases equally satisfactory results were
had.</p>

<p>Dr. D. A. Baldwin, of Englewood, N. J., entirely controlled
the convulsions in a young man of 16 with <i>&#338;nanthe</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Ord reports a case of petit mal cured with the 3x, and
in a South American hom&#339;opathic journal a Dr. Rappaz reports
the cure of a case of three years' standing with increasing
seizures with the remedy in doses ranging from the 6 to
the 12.</p>

<p>The late Dr. W. A. Dunn reported a genuine cure of a
young girl of 16 who had been epileptic for 7 years, latterly
having as many as 4 or 5 attacks during a night. The remedy<span class="pagenum">[Pg 246]</span>
caused these attacks to entirely disappear. The girl commenced
menstruating at 12, so the establishment of the
menses had nothing to do with the cure.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles A. Wilson, of San Antonio, Texas, reports a
number of cases cured with <i>&#338;nanthe</i> in the 3x dilution, and
the same potency greatly lessened the number of seizures in
others.</p>

<p>Dr. Purdon, of the University of Dublin, relates a case of
epilepsy cured with this drug in 1 to 6 drop doses several
times a day.</p>

<p>Dr. F. E. Howard, in a case which had 3 or 4 attacks a
week, gave 5 drops of the tincture every two hours, which
caused violent pains in the head, but complete recovery followed
on reducing the dose.</p>

<p>Several cases of the cure of epilepsy with <i>&#338;nanthe</i> in alternation
with <i>Silicea</i> or some other drug have been reported,
but as the question, "which cured?" comes in they need not
be given.</p>

<p>In my own practice I have had some marked results from
its action and have seen it modify attacks when everything
else failed. In two cases, one a boy of 13 who had had the
disease 5 years and who had suffered much of many sphincter-stretching
orificialists and "lots of other things," the remedy
made a complete cure; the other case was in a man of 30
who had the grand mal, the petit mal and the epileptic
vertigo. <i>&#338;nanthe</i> removed entirely the two former conditions
leaving only the latter, and that in a very mild degree.
It also greatly improved the mental condition of the patient.</p>

<p>I have several cases under treatment at the present time,
and some of them are showing a marked effect from its use.
The question of dose I believe to be an important one. I used
generally the tincture in water, but latterly I have been using
the third, and I believe with better effect than I ever obtained
with the tincture, and I am now of the opinion that the lower
dilutions, say from the 3 to the 12, will be found more efficacious
than the tincture, and the higher potencies will suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
certain cases. In order to prescribe the drug with accuracy
provings will be necessary to develop its finer symptomatology.</p>

<blockquote><p>(This proving was made by Dr. Wahle, of Germany, who
was the chemist of Hahnemann. He never published it, but
gave the manuscript to his son, who in his turn gave it to
Dr. Held, now a practicing physician in Rome. Dr. Held at
the request of his colleagues translated it into Italian and it
appeared in the medical journal, <i>L'Omiopatia in Italia</i>, from
which this article is translated and slightly condensed. The
remedy is used by the hom&#339;opaths of Rome and found to
be valuable in uterine and other troubles, indicated by the
proving. It is particularly serviceable in constipation.)</p></blockquote>

passing across the stomach with much thirst. Five hours
later there occurred alvine discharges; the first was very hard
with much tenesmus, so that the whole abdomen was retracted;
the last discharges were fluid, abundant and without

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The dry plant is macerated in five parts by
weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. Edward Fornias contributed to the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i>, 1886, two
papers on this remedy. The first gave the results of physiological experiments;
the second is a résumé of those results, including the proving by Dr.
B. H. B. Sleght, as follows:)</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Résumé of Symptoms.</i>&mdash;If we boil down the matter, extracting
only the symptoms and changes observed during the above
experiments with <i>Parthenina</i>, we have the following: <i>Heaviness
and dulness of head, tendency to vertigo, malaise, apathy,
lassitude, profuse and very fluid salivation, sensation of heat
and weight in the stomach, increased appetite, gastric intolerance,
nausea and vomiting. Increased stupor, desire to be
quiet, refusal of food, and indifference. Excitation of the
heart beats, or slow beating of the heart; depressed circulation,
or general functional activity; pulse accelerated, or slow,
weak, soft, compressible, without dicrotism; progressive slowing
of the pulse, followed by syncope, cardiac paralysis</i> (and
death). <i>Accelerated, or slow, irregular breathing</i> (<i>Cheyne-Stokes</i>);
<i>rise and fall of temperature, tremors, shivering,
diminished perspiration; dilation of the pupils; convulsions</i>
(clonic and tonic); <i>muscular relaxation, anæsthesia and increased
urine and saliva</i>. <i>The kidneys were found enlarged
and congested, with evident signs of sanguineous stasis. The
process of coagulation of the blood was retarded. The red
corpuscles increased in volume. There was a fall of the blood-pressure,
and vascular dilatation</i> (of reflex origin). <i>The
heart was found arrested in diastole, and the brain anæmic.
A marked diminution of reflex action in the hips and extinction
of the voluntary movements, were noticed. Also a</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
<i>transient excitement of the voluntary movements. And
finally the sensibility and the muscular contractility were
diminished.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cases Cured by Parthenina.</span>&mdash;In regard to the therapeutic
value of <i>Parthenina</i>, little is known as yet, but the
plant from which this alkaloid is derived, as said before, has
been employed for years in Cuba, both by the people and profession,
against fevers of a paludal origin.</p>

<p>Dr. Ramirez Tovar has reported in several numbers of the
<i>Cronica Médico-Quirúrgica</i>, of Havana, the following cases
treated by him with <i>Parthenina</i>, with the best results:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case I.</span>&mdash;"A lady living in the lower part of the city,
where the rain always leaves constant channels of infection,
was suffering with <i>daily attacks of intermittent</i>, which grew
more intense every day. She received 1 gram of the salt,
divided in six powders, to be taken one every hour after the
attack. The next day she had no chill, and the thermometer
indicated the absence of fever. She was nursing at the time,
and stated that she had noticed a marked increase of milk in
her breasts; 50 centigrams more, in doses, were given to her,
and the fever did not return again."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case II.</span>&mdash;"A tailor, 30 years of age, had moved to the
lower part of the city and contracted a <i>tertian intermittent</i>.
He had four paroxysms before the doctor saw him, the last
one being <i>attended by much pain in the left hypochondrium</i>.
He received 1 gram, in 5 doses. There was apyrexia on the
day the attack was due, and this did not return again. This
man continued to live in the same house, under the same
regimen and hygienic conditions."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case III,</span>&mdash;"A little girl, 6 years of age, lymphatic constitution,
living near the beach of the harbor, was brought to
Dr. Ramirez Tovar's clinic, suffering for 17 days with <i>malaise,
loss of appetite, sleepiness and fever</i>. She had taken quinine,
both internally and externally, with little benefit, and <i>was
wasting away notably</i>. At 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> she commenced to take
50 centigrams of the salt, in 8 doses, and the next day at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
same hour the thermometer indicated a fall from 39.5° C. of
the previous day to 38.5° C. The mother was ordered to repeat
the medicine at longer intervals, but for want of means
the child did not take any more. On the 4th or 5th day the
temperature went up to 39.5° again, then she was provided
with the medicine, and 3 days later the temperature was
normal. The action of the alkaloid was aided here by a tonic
wine prepared from the extract of the plant."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case IV.</span>&mdash;"A man 45 years of age, <i>of delicate constitution,
poorly nourished, with a straw yellow face, yellow sclerotics,
enlarged liver and spleen, the latter somewhat painful to
pressure</i>, who had contracted <i>intermittent fever</i> while in
Panama, and had taken quinine, was complaining, when Dr.
Ramirez Tovar saw him (middle part of December), <i>of a pain
in the right side</i> (more severe in some points than in others),
which commenced at 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, with <i>shiverings</i>, and which disappeared
after two hours to return again the next day at precisely
the same time and with the same symptoms. He received
1 gram of <i>Parthenina</i>, in 5 doses, one every hour, right
after the cessation of the pain. He was seen by the doctor
the next day at 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and up to that time the pain had not
returned. He took then 50 centigrams more, in 5 doses, one
every hour, and was free of pain until the latter part of
January, when he again consulted the doctor, this time the
<i>pain being located in the stomach</i>, for which <i>Parthenina</i> was
repeated (1 gram in 5 doses, one every two hours). The next
day the pain had ceased, but returned on the third, and he
again received 1 gram, in the same manner as before, and
since then he has been free from pain."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case V.</span>&mdash;"A young lady, 18 years of age, complained of
<i>facial neuralgia with periodical exacerbations</i>, from which
she was suffering four days. She received 1 gram of <i>Parthenina</i>,
in 5 doses, one every hour, and on the following day
she was entirely free from pain. Fifty centigrams more, in 4
doses, were given to this lady to prevent a relapse, and the
result was a complete cure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>And to finish this report, I will mention a case which came
under my notice: "A little girl, my niece, 5 years old, living
in Havana, who, when seen by the late Dr. Govantes, of that
city, had been suffering for some time before from <i>a continued
fever, with periodical mid-day exacerbations, which later on,
assumed an intermittent type</i>. She had been saturated with
<i>quinine</i>, and complained, at the time, of <i>malaise</i>, <i>lassitude</i>,
<i>languor</i>, <i>headache</i>, <i>loss of appetite</i>, <i>gastric intolerance</i>, <i>etc.</i>
The temperature went up as high as 40.6° C. during the hot
stage, which was short and was followed by copious sweats,
giving relief. <i>Parthenium hysterophorus</i> in the form of an
extract, prepared and sold at Dr. Villavicenci's Pharmacy, in
Havana, was prescribed by Dr. Govantes. Three doses a day,
each of the size of a pea, dissolved in water, were given for 4
or 5 days, and at the end of that time she was entirely free of
fever and made a quick recovery."</p>

<p>If such results can be ascribed to <i>Parthenium</i> and its alkaloid
<i>Parthenina</i>, I think it would be unjustifiable to set them
aside. An early proving of the plant will not only enhance
our therapeutic resources, but prevent the non-scrupulous from
employing it empirically.</p>

<h3>PASSIFLORA INCARNATA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Passifloraceæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Passion flower.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The fresh leaves and flowers gathered in May
are macerated in two parts by weight of alcohol. A preparation
may also be made from the expressed juice of the fresh leaves.</p>

<blockquote><p>(There has been so much written concerning this unproved remedy that
we can only give an abstract of a part of it. Dr. Lindsay, formerly of Bayou
Gras, La., was the first to call attention to it a few weeks before his death.
He wrote in answer to an inquiry as follows&mdash;Hale's New Remedies):</p></blockquote>

<p>I have much to say. I am satisfied it is no narcotic. It
never stupefies or overpowers the senses. A patient under its
full influence may be wakened up, and he will talk to you as
rationally as ever he did; leave him a moment and he will
soon be off to the Elysian Fields again. I have tried it, my
friend, in all sorts of neuralgic affections, and have usually
astonished my more enlightened patients with it. Many
times I have had them to ask me what in the world it was
that had such a sweet influence over them.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. L. Phares, of Newtonia, Miss., states):</p></blockquote>

<p>I never saw anything act so promptly in erysipelas. I
have used it with advantage in ulcers, neuralgias and tetanus.
I have seen wonderful effects of it in relieving tetanus, and
will mention one case from memory: Some ten years ago I
was called to see an old lady, in a distant part of the country,
who was reported to be "having fits." I found her to be
able to be up most of the time, but, while examining her,
convulsions came on, affecting mainly the trunkal muscles,
and drawing the head back. I gave her instantly a dose of
<i>Passiflora</i>. The convulsions subsided, and she has never had
one since. I continued the use of the medicine in small
doses for a few days. I have used it in treating tetanus in
horses&mdash;a disease usually considered as inevitably fatal to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>that noble animal. It has never failed to cure the horse.
* * During the late war, my son, Dr. J. H. Phares, had
occasion many times to prescribe the <i>Passiflora</i> for tetanus in
horses, with one invariable result&mdash;prompt, perfect, permanent
cure. He fortunately saw no case in man. * * *
Since the foregoing was written, I have treated with the
hydro-alcoholic extract of <i>Passiflora</i> several cases of neuralgia,
and one of sleeplessness, with incessant motion and suicidal
mania. With the same extract during the current week,
Dr. J. H. Phares has treated, with the most prompt and satisfactory
success, a very virulent and hopeless case of tetanus,
with ophisthotonos, trismus and convulsions, in a child two
years old. Other most potent remedies, in heroic doses, having
failed to produce any effect in this case, he thinks that
nothing but the <i>Passiflora</i> could possibly have saved the
child.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The editor of the <i>California Medical Journal</i> (1889) says):</p></blockquote>

<p>We have been employing it [<i>Passiflora</i>] in some cases of
spinal meningitis after the acute symptoms had subsided,
when the patients were unable to sleep, either day or night:
could not endure the bed, and were unable to maintain the
sitting posture, with highly satisfactory results. It is administered
in small doses. Add ten drops of the mother tincture
(Hom&#339;opathic) to half a tumbler of water; teaspoonful
every two hours.</p>

<blockquote><p>(At the meeting of the Hom&#339;opathic Medical Society of Delaware and
Peninsula, November 14, 1889, Dr. W. D. Troy read a paper on <i>Passiflora</i>
(see <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i>, May, 1890), from which we take the following):</p></blockquote>

<p>My erysipelatous case was a man of some fifty years. When
first seen was a-bed, high fever, facial erysipelas of the flaming,
rampant sort, the one eye had disappeared, the other was
in rapid retreat. Patient in great anxiety; sharp, stinging
pains; could not rest. Was about to give <i>Apis</i> when I
thought of my <i>Passion flower</i>. Gave two-drop doses of the
tincture every two hours. Put one-half an ounce of same
into one quart of water for local application, to be applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
hot by flannels and oiled silk. After six hours patient fell
asleep; was awakened for medicine every three hours during
the night; went to sleep easily after each dose. Said in
morning he had had a night's good rest. Found inflammation
markedly reduced. I now changed the remedy&mdash;gave
<i>Ham.</i>, both internally and externally. On next visit found
patient every way worse. The disease had sneaked across
the scalp and invaded the whole face. The case began to
look serious. Returned to the <i>Passiflora</i> and kept to it with
the most happy results.</p>

<p>My next experience was in a Chorea&mdash;a girl budding into
womanhood, but in whom the menses had not yet appeared.
Child was well developed for her years, fourteen. I learned
that for two or three years past the child had "fits," varying at
times from moderate to severe. The neurosis was unilateral,
the right side alone being affected. The child had had traditional
treatment, "off and on," for some time without manifest
improvement. I began with the <i>Passiflora</i> 1x dil., 10 gtt. doses
every three hours. Kept it up for several days, the Choreic
symptoms being not quite so violent; still I was growing
anxious&mdash;wanted more positive results. Added daily a five-drop
dose of tincture. After a few more days the mother informed
me that there had been a slight "show"&mdash;merely
enough to stain the diaper, and that for the last two days
there had been hardly any "fits." This was encouraging. I
judged that the day of deliverance was nigh. Very little
more of the drug was given until about the time for next
menstrual flux. Then I resumed it with the most satisfactory
results. No nervous symptoms save such as are more or
lest common to all women at the "periods" subsequently prevailed.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following case was reported by Dr. D. C. Buell Dunlevy, of Port
Chester, N. Y.&mdash;<i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i>, Nov., 1890):</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;, æt. 52, sent for me to attend him during the
month of May. I found him presenting all the prodromal
symptoms of delirium tremens, and at once ordered him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
bed, and none too soon, as the event proved. For seven days
he tossed about in a wild delirium, which was greatly aggravated
by marked gastric irritation. I had him carefully
watched, both day and night, until the delirium wore off.
The treatment up to this time was <i>Cannabis Ind.</i> for the
mental trouble and <i>Nux v.</i>, which greatly relieved the gastric
symptoms. But the moment he began to improve the old
cravings for liquor and morphine returned. Right here let
me say that for years he has been a great sufferer from piles,
and the only rest he could get was to sit propped up in his
chair. His sufferings caused him to seek relief during the
day in liquor, and at nights in morphine. And this habit
had so fastened itself upon him that try as he might he could
not give it up. When he came under my treatment I at once
put a stop to all stimulants and narcotics, but not without
considerable trouble, for he seemed determined to have them.
Night after night he would lie there calling for something to
make him sleep, and this kept up until he was bordering on
a state of insanity. Fully realizing that something must be
done, and that quickly, too, I made up my mind to try <i>Passiflora</i>.
This I did, and from the time I gave him the first
dose improvement set in and has continued ever since. I at
first gave him a half teaspoonful of the &#952; at bed time, but
this not proving sufficient I increased it to a teaspoonful. He
has now been taking it almost constantly for a period of
eight weeks and claims he has not had as natural a sleep for
years; and lays particular stress on the fact that when he
awakes in the morning he feels so refreshed and his mind remains
clear. But what seems even more wonderful is that
from the day he first took this drug up to the present he has
never felt the slightest desire to return to his former habits.
The mere mention of liquor or opium seems to sicken him,
and I am fully satisfied that he is now cured and will (so far
as liquor and opium are concerned) remain so. He now
takes special delight in praising the drug to his friends, and
really seems never to tire talking about the wonderful help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
it has been to him. I have also prescribed the drug to
others for insomnia and always with success, one case excepted,
in which I gave it for hemicrania, and here, although
it quieted the patient, it failed to produce the desired sleep.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following is extracted from a paper on <i>Passiflora</i>, by Dr. C. A. Walters,
of Brooklyn. <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i>, July, 1890:)</p></blockquote>

<p>In April, 1888, was called to an infant, 14 months, convulsions,
caused by dentition; symptoms called for <i>Belladonna</i>,
of which the 1x dil., 5 drops in half a glass water, teaspoonful
every fifteen minutes until better, then once an hour.
The child improved from start, and the convulsions ceased in
one hour from commencing the medicine. The next day the
child appeared in usual health, and the <i>Belladonna</i> was given
once in eight hours and discharged from further attendance.</p>

<p>Thirty-six hours after I was recalled, the child was in another
spasm. No <i>Belladonna</i> symptoms being present I gave
5 drops of <i>Passiflora</i> tincture, every fifteen minutes, with the
result that it never had another spasm from that day to this.
The child slept soundly all through the night and awoke the
next morning in its usual good health.</p>

<p>Since then I have prescribed it for the sleeplessness of dentition
without a failure, giving it usually in from 5 to 10
drops a dose, to be repeated every fifteen minutes until sleep.
I never give it during the day for this purpose, but begin at
bedtime.</p>

<p>In the insomnia of adults, from whatsoever cause, I always
give 60 drops at bedtime, and if not asleep in half an hour I
give the same dose.</p>

<p>Experience has taught me that to give it in smaller doses
is a waste of time and disappointing to the patient. Two
such doses, <i>i.e.</i>, 60 drops a dose, are almost absolutely sure of
giving the patient a natural and refreshing sleep. The old
school seem to have been forced to resort to <i>Sulfonal</i> (whatever
that may be) as the only thing capable of producing
sleep, and yet, judging from the reports in their journals, it
does not seem to "fill the bill." Were they ever to give this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
a trial we would not hear so much of <i>Morphine</i>, <i>Chloral</i>,
<i>Bromides</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>I have never used <i>Passiflora</i> in erysipelas, having always
been able to discharge my patients in from two to four days
by giving them <i>Jaborandi</i>.</p>

<p>In neuralgia and headache it has acted with wonderful rapidity,
even the headache of uterine displacements being
brought under its influence. It is almost a daily occurrence
to have people whom I never saw before come miles to my
office for that "sleeping medicine made from the passion
flower."</p>

<p>In conclusion let me say to the brethren, try it. But give
it in appreciable doses. Don't be afraid of it. I would not
hesitate to give it in four drachm doses, if required. But why
give four when one will do?</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Since writing the foregoing I have used <i>Passiflora</i>
in two cases of delirium tremens. It acted like a charm in
both cases; sent them to sleep in half an hour, and when
they awoke, twelve and fourteen hours after, they were
themselves again. Sixty drops of tincture a dose, two doses
in each.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following was reported by Dr. Joseph Adolphus, in <i>American Medical
Journal</i>:)</p></blockquote>

<p>A lady who had for several months suffered untold agonies,
as she described her sufferings; her pain was described as if a
weight of many pounds was lying on her brain; the sense of
pressure and tearing inside the skull was fearful; her head
felt as if enveloped in ice; the pains ran down the back of
her neck, and finally reached the lower end of sacrum, so
that a slight touch of the coccyx caused exquisite agony.
This was a case in which coccygodinia was associated with
the cerebral and spinal disease. I failed to relieve the pain
for more than a few hours at a time with all other remedies
I had tried; at this juncture, when despair was taking
the place of hope, I thought of <i>Passiflora</i>, which I then administered
in teaspoonful doses every two hours; the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
was something to be remembered, for she enjoyed excellent
and refreshing night's rest the following night, waking up in
the morning much refreshed, nearly free from pain, with a
good relish for breakfast. I continued the medicament every
four hours for several days, for no further uses for medicine
seemed indicated, as there was a rapid and complete recovery.</p>

<p>A lady complained of pain in her rectum continuously;
the coccyx was also quite tender to the touch. There were
several erosions on the lips of the os uteri; leucorrh&#339;a and
severe pain in the small of the back when a certain spot
(over last dorsal and first and second lumbar vertebræ) was
pressed on. I found she had been treated secundum artem
for the uterine trouble, locally and constitutionally, to no
certain satisfactory result. Her respirations were often
twenty-eight to thirty per minute, much wakefulness, and at
times feeling of constriction across her breast and a sense as
if her heart would stop beating. Teaspoonful doses of the
<i>Passiflora incar.</i> was the specific in her case. She continued
it every four hours two weeks, but from the outset of treatment
she felt the right remedy was administered.</p>

<p>These rectum troubles in women are frequently met with
in practice. I find the <i>Passiflora incar.</i> the best single remedy
I have for them.</p>

<p>Recently a man consulted me for a constant pain in his
heart; he described it as sharp and like a pang&mdash;often causing
a sense of immediate dissolution, and fear of death was
on him all the time; pulse irregular in rhythm, now rapid,
next slower, occasionally a beat missing; sounds very normal,
but accentuated and sharp. <i>Passiflora incarnata</i> was a
specific in this case; no doubt the center and probably the
local ganglia were irritated from some cause, and, whatever
it was, the medicament removed both.</p>

<p>By the way, I must not forget to say you will find it a valuable
medicament in sleeplessness and tossing restlessness in
your fever patients. I use the tincture in teaspoonful doses
every four hours. It appears the remedy has a soothing ef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>fect
on the whole nervous system, without any appreciable
narcotic properties.</p>

<blockquote><p>(From the Transactions of the Twenty-fifth Annual Meeting of the Maine
Hom&#339;opathic Medical Society we take the following from a paper by Dr.
A. I. Harvey on <i>Passiflora</i>:)</p></blockquote>

<p>It does no good where the inability to sleep is due to pain
or distress of any kind; but in cases where we find that the
nervous erethism is not controlled by the action of <i>Coffea</i>,
<i>Opium</i>, <i>Sulphur</i>, or other apparently indicated remedy. <i>Passiflora</i>
is in its place as a succedaneum for <i>Morphia</i> or other
sedatives. The dose varies from ten drops to one dram of
the tincture, according to the age of the patient. I do not
hesitate, in the case of an adult, to give dram doses of the
tincture every hour until the patient sleeps, and have seen it
act in the happiest manner in restoring the rhythm of the
heart's action, when that organ has been deranged in its
movements by the combined effects of exhaustion and loss of
sleep.</p>

<p><i>Passiflora</i> has also given me much aid in a case of morphine
habit of six years' standing, which I cured wholly and entirely
by the use of this remedy. It is recommended in the
above mentioned doses for delirium tremens, trismus, tetanus
and kindred diseases of the nervous system, repeated every
hour or half-hour until relief is obtained. The remedy leaves
no after effects, is incapable of creating an appetite, and, so
far as my observation extends, it is perfectly harmless even in
large doses, often repeated.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. Scudder claimed that the one great indication for <i>Passiflora</i> in all
cases is <i>a clean tongue</i>; when the tongue is foul the remedy will do no
good.)</p></blockquote>

<h3>PENTHORUM SEDOIDES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Crassulaceæ.<br />

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The whole fresh plant with the root is macerated

<blockquote><p>(The <i>Medical Advance</i> for June, 1887, contains a paper by Dr. D. B.
Morrow, from which the following is taken.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The object of this paper is to call attention to the fact that
the only proving of <i>Penthorum</i> was made on scientific principles,
as these verifications demonstrate. If the pathogenesy
is carefully studied, it will be seen to meet all the conditions
of "common colds," or acute catarrhs, so prevalent in all sections
of North America, from the symptoms of chill, malaise,
headache, soreness, cough, coryza, dry and flowing, with their
secondary consequences of disturbed digestion, constipation,
debility, etc. and it will probably cure any or all of these conditions
when indicated by correspondence to the pathogenesy.</p>

<p>A medicine having such a catarrhal range is probably a
remedy for female troubles equal to <i>Pulsatilla</i> or <i>Calcarea</i>,
and is worthy of a careful proving by women. It cures
where antipsoric medicines have failed, and possibly may
possess antipsoric qualities.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In 1896 and 1897 Dr. A. M. Cushing wrote several articles on this new
remedy, and among them the following, which appeared in the <i>Hom&#339;opathic
Recorder</i>, 1897.)</p></blockquote>

<p>While making a proving of the above remedy I felt a sudden
curious sensation in the region of the heart, and immediately
felt of my pulse and found it <i>very weak and fluttering</i>.
I have been asked what that sensation was, but I can't
describe it, for, to tell the truth, I believe I was frightened
and failed to remember it. Although it is unpleasant to be
badly frightened, the nice results I have seen from the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the remedy and the kind words I have received from the profession
in regard to it has more than paid for the little fright.
As so little is known of the remedy, I wish to report one case
that was not at all indicated by the proving and two cases
under the care of an old school doctor. My case was that of
a lady aged about forty, who for two years was under the care
of a hom&#339;opathic doctor for some trouble, I don't know
what; then two years under the care of another hom&#339;opathic
doctor for a fibroid of the uterus. She had twice consulted
a specialist in Boston, who said it could not be removed.
Then she came under my care with a fibroid as large as a
fetus at full term. Suffice it to say, I gave remedies in a
higher attenuation than I believed she had taken, and in a
few months the tumor had greatly diminished and gave her
no trouble. Still she was nervous and had neuralgic pains
almost all over her. As remedies did not seem to relieve her
for any length of time, I decided to give her <i>Phaseolus</i> 9x, as
it probably would do as well as what I had given her. The
next time I called she met me with "I want a whole bottle
like what you gave me last." She does not have to take any
medicine now.</p>

<p>I was called in consultation with an old school doctor to a
case of confinement. Patient, 26; first child; had been in
pain forty-eight hours, but not severe till the last twelve
hours. Patient, fleshy; urine heavily loaded with albumen.
I knew that trouble was ahead, as she became blind. I found
the head jacked firmly in the superior straits, face presentation
which I could not change. I decided to wait a little,
help what I could and watch the results. In a little while
she went to sleep, the first quiet sleep in forty-eight hours;
but when she moved it was in a fearful convulsion. I expected
the convulsions, but felt that if I applied the forceps,
before they appeared some might say if he had let her alone
she would not have had them. I immediately turned her
upon her left side, well covered up, and adjusted my forceps
and soon had the head through the bony parts; and as it is<span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span>
my custom to remove the forceps till the soft parts are dilated
to prevent rupture I commenced to do so, when a fearful expulsive
convulsion threw forceps and a thirteen-pound child
into the bed with a complete rupture of the perineum&mdash;my
first such case in forty-one years. While she was unconscious
I took the necessary stitches, the doctor attending to
the medical part. One hour later, when I was in the kitchen
helping the nurse and a few damsels dress the baby, the doctor
came to me and said her heart was failing in its action
fast. I gave him a vial of No. 25 globules medicated with 9x
<i>Phaseolus</i>, and told him to give her a dose about the size of
a bean (being a bean remedy). Ten minutes later he said:
"That is wonderful, her heart is all right." Three times
during the night he had to repeat it with the same results.
Afterwards she had no trouble.</p>

<p>One week later the same doctor came to me saying: "I
want a bottle of that remedy." Yesterday I was called to see
a lady who was unconscious, pulseless, breathing ten times a
minute, beyond hope as I supposed. I gave her three doses
of <i>Phaseolus</i>, and she is all right.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;If not too late, I would like to add a little to the
paper I sent you not long ago. The same old school doctor
to whom I referred in that paper tells me he has used
<i>Phaseolus</i> in another case of heart disease with a success similar
to the others reported.</p>

<p>A few weeks since a lady aged 50, nurse by profession,
came to me saying, at times, she had fearful time with her
heart palpitating and feeling as if she should die. Being in
great haste, I made no examination, but gave her a vial of
<i>Phaseolus</i> 15x to take a dose three or four times a day, as
needed. Yesterday she called, saying she was going out of
the city, but did not dare to go without some more of the
medicine, for she <i>never took anything in her life that did so
much good as that</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</span></p>
<blockquote><p>(Dr. Cushing also read the following paper before the Massachusetts
Hom&#339;opathic Medical Society, which we take from the <i>New England
Medical Gazette</i>. January, 1897:)</p></blockquote>

<p>By request I appear before you to-day, and I presume you
will be disappointed if my paper is not on some new remedy;
and such it is,&mdash;a remedy, I think, worthy the careful investigation
of every hom&#339;opathic physician,&mdash;phaseolus nana,
or the common white bean. It is unnecessary for me to say
to you that Boston is called a bean-eating city, or refer to the
many sudden deaths there or in its vicinity from brain or
heart trouble, nor how in a certain way young men grow
old. Can you tell me the cause? I shall not take the time
to report the proving I made, nor why I began it, nor how I
prepared it, nor its wonderful effects upon the nervous system,
the genital organs, stomach, bowels, or kidneys, in the provings,
referring only to three symptoms. A medical student
has made a short but interesting proving of the remedy, confirming
some of my symptoms. While my proving was going
on nicely, I suddenly felt a curious sensation in the region
of the heart. It was so sudden and strange I immediately
felt of my pulse and found it very irregular and feeble, so
much so I think I was frightened, at least I did not take any
more of the medicine. Never before had I had any irregular
action of the heart. Soon after, I read that foreign physicians
were using a decoction of the growing bean and pod
for dropsy.</p>

<p>About that time I was called to see a hopeless case of
uterine cancer with severe general dropsy. I prescribed the
best I knew and decided to try the bean remedy. Several
days elapsed before I could get any, and then only the dry
pods, as it was in December. I steeped them and gave it
with apparent relief. I report this case more especially to
speak of the final result. I called one day expecting to find
her quite comfortable, but found her dead. She suddenly
screamed, "Oh, my head!" grasped it with both hands and
was dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>Months later, after an experience with another patient
which I will report later, it suddenly dawned upon me that
possibly the bean decoction might have hastened her death.</p>

<p>I was called to see a man about forty-five, suffering from
general dropsy with heart and other complications, who had
been under the care of a hom&#339;opathic physician some time.
Although he had taken <i>Digitalis</i>, <i>Strophanthus</i>, <i>Strychnia</i>,
<i>Nitroglycerine</i>, salts, etc., he had been unable to lie down for
two weeks. I prescribed for him, but as soon as I could I
prepared and gave him the bean-pod decoction. In about one
week he was able to lie down in bed, and his legs, which at
my first visit measured over twenty-one inches in circumference,
measured fifteen inches. Then hay fever appeared,
and by the advice of nineteen or twenty-five women an old-school
expert from New York was called and I was left out.</p>

<p>The following cases, having symptoms similar to those developed
in the proving, were given the same preparations as
those used in the proving.</p>

<p>A man aged sixty-nine, a retired clergyman on account of
a heart disease that had troubled him many years, yet no
physician had been able to satisfactorily diagnose, came
home from a trip where he had unwisely preached twice,
greatly exhausted. The heart's action was weak and irregular,
growing weaker each day for a few days, when he was
entirely pulseless at both wrists, which continued four days
in spite of my best efforts. I then gave him <i>Phaseolus</i> 9x,
and in a few hours there was an improvement, and in thirty-six
hours his pulse was regular and strong, about seventy per
minute; and it remained so till my last visit, one-half hour
before his death, two weeks after beginning the medicine. I
was called to New York and returned too late to make a <i>post-mortem</i>
examination. Among his children were a public
school teacher and a college professor. I told them what I
was giving, and they watched the case very closely and were
surprised at its effects. Later they asked me if I would send
some of the same medicine to a friend in Connecticut who<span class="pagenum">[Pg 284]</span>
had no money but a bad heart, said by the doctor there and
an expert in Boston to be a weak heart. I sent the medicine
and two weeks later they wrote: "His breath is not as short,
his limbs were not as badly swollen, could walk and sleep
better, but they did not know as he was any better." I sent
more medicine and have not heard from that.</p>

<p>A lady living in the West, aged about fifty, had been ailing
several years. Her greatest complaint was a weak, bad-aching
heart. I treated her a few months with general improvement,
but she complained of a weak, tired, bad-acting
and bad-feeling heart. I sent her <i>Phaseolus</i> 9x, and later
she wrote me that forty-eight hours after commencing the
last medicine sent her heart wheeled into line all right and
remains so.</p>

<p>A lady, aged eighty-seven, had diarrh&#339;a, which was soon
relieved; then I found her heart acted badly, about every
third beat omitted, and she said it had been so for a year or
more. I gave her <i>Phaseolus</i>, and two days later her pulse
was all right.</p>

<p>Dr. Brown, of Springfield, reported a case of a young man
that only once in two weeks did he get his pulse up to
sixty, ranging from fifty to fifty-five the two weeks. He
gave <i>Phaseolus</i> 6, which I furnished him, and the next forenoon
his pulse was seventy-two and remained so.</p>

<p>I will report only one more case, treated with this remedy,
one which I think very interesting.</p>

<p>A lady physician, aged thirty, married, no children, never
has been sick except with childhood diseases. Two years
ago had considerable mental trouble and rode a bicycle a good
deal. Since that time, two years ago, five times each minute,
or about that, her heart would give one hard unpleasant
throb, then omit one beat, this in the day time, but much
worse at night, preventing sleep. Being in somewhat of a
hurry, I did not examine the heart, thinking there would be
a plenty of time later, but gave her <i>Phaseolus</i>, the 10th I think.
Thirty-six hours later the heart would beat one hundred con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>secutive
times without the slightest variation, and it continued
to improve, although after taking the medicine thirty-six
hours she was obliged to desist on account of a severe headache.
She is never subject to headaches, but it was so bad
she dared not take any more of the medicine. It was as if
something was pressing hard against each temple, much
worse soon after taking each dose of the medicine. This
headache led me to fear that the death I mentioned might
have been hastened by the medicine.</p>

<p>A medical conundrum. A lady, aged about thirty, decided
she would investigate the next world to see if she could enjoy
it better than this, and called in the aid of morphine to help
her along. Not being in the habit of taking morphine, to
disguise the bitter of it, placed a tablet of morphine in the
middle of a baked bean and swallowed it whole. She took
her little dose in the evening, having eaten nothing since
noon, and went to sleep. At seven in the morning she
awoke and was surprised to find herself in this world. When
asked if she would get up, replied, no, she would sleep a little
longer. At eleven <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> she awoke and tried to get up,
but could not walk, so crawled to the door and opened it to
let in fresh air. A servant found her there, and at her request
handed her the camphor bottle, and she took a little.
Dr. Rowe was called and said she vomited a little mucus,
some dark specks that looked like blood, and a small piece
of lettuce she ate the noon before. She had taken twelve
and one-half grains of morphine. Did the lettuce antidote
it? Did the bean destroy its power? Why did it not kill
her?</p>

<blockquote><p>(Contributed by Dr. S. A. Jones to the <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i>, 1889.)</p></blockquote>

<p>This perennial, odorous member of the natural order
<i>Araceæ</i> is one of our most common meadow and bog plants.
From its very realistic, skunk-like odor when cut or bruised,
and its resemblance in shape of leaf and mode of growth to
the cabbage, it has been commonly well known as the skunk
cabbage.</p>

<p>Belonging to the same family as the Calla lily and Indian
turnip, the shape of its flower becomes at once familiar to
anyone who observes it. Among the first plants to flower in
spring is this species, and by closely observing the surface of
any boggy meadow in the latter part of March or early April
one will find irrupting the earth like mushroom the points of
many beautiful spathes gaping open to extend invitations to
the earliest slugs and carrion beetles of the season. These
are the flowers of Pothos appearing some time before the
leaves, and when divested of the mud that clings to them, and
polished with a damp cloth, as the apple-woman serves her
pippins, they shine out in beautiful mottled purple, orange,
and deep red, and, being very fleshy, will keep up appearances
many days if cut deep and placed in hyacinth jars.</p>

<p>The root is large, thick, and cylindrical, giving off its
lower end numerous long, cylindrical branches; the leaves
which appear on the fertilization of the ovary are large,
smooth, entire, and deeply plaited into rounded folds. On
opening the pointed spathe or floral envelope, a club-like
mass will be noted arising from its base. This is the spadix
bearing the naked flowers, which are perfect, consisting of
a four-angled style and four awl-shaped stamens. The fruit,
when mature, is a globular, ill-smelling, glutinous mass, consisting
of the enlarged, fleshy spadix and changed perianths,
and enclosing several large bullet-like seeds.</p>

<p>The roots are easily gathered, one alone being sufficient to
make a year's stock of tincture for the most lavish practitioner.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</span><span class="smcap">The Tincture.</span></p>

<p>Take the fresh root stalks and rootlets, gathered in spring
on the first appearance of the flowers, and chop and pound
them to a pulp, and weigh. Then taking two parts, by
weight, of alcohol, mix the pulp with one-sixth part of it, add
the balance, and, after stirring the whole well, pour it into a
well-stoppered bottle and let it stand for eight days in a
dark, cool place. After straining and filtering, the resulting
tincture should be of a light brown color and have a slightly
acrid taste and a neutral reaction.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chemistry.</span></p>

<p>The active principle of this plant is doubtless volatile, as
the dried root presents none of the acridity of the fresh, and
is odorless as well. Dr. J. M. Turner determined in the root
a volatile fatty body, a volatile oil, a fixed oil, and a specific
resin.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On the 16th of December, 1887, there came into my hands
a case that the family physician (a hom&#339;opath) had pronounced
epilepsy and declared incurable. Upon being consulted,
his diagnosis had been confirmed and his prognosis
corroborated by the late Prof. E. S. Dunster, of the University
of Michigan.</p>

<p>Up to date that identical patient has had neither a "fit"
nor any approximation thereto, and that fact is an occasion of
this paper. One who already discerns the first gray shadows
of that night which comes to all, does not now write at
the urging, or the <i>itching</i>, of the Ego. He disclaims any
merit, having evinced only a monkey-like imitativeness. He
had from the Infinite, the gift of a good memory, and an old
book, picked up one happy day at a street stall, flashed into
recollection some twelve years later, and enabled him then to
imitate the much earlier doing of its worthy author&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"Only the actions of the just</span>
<span class="i0">Smell sweet and blossom in the dust."</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 288]</span>This dead worthy&mdash;he that was James Thacher, M. D.&mdash;more
than any other, made known the virtues of <i>Pothos
f&#339;tida</i>, and gratitude for what his book had taught me to do
made me feel that to write up this forgotten remedy were the
fittest return that I could make for his well doing.</p>

<p>A second incentive, ample enough, is found in the fact that
the first hom&#339;opathic paper on <i>Pothos f&#339;t.</i> has never had a
faithful translation into our language, and has not been critically
reproduced in any other. A study of the <i>Hom&#339;opathic
Bibliography</i>, as given in this paper, will teach an impressive
lesson not only to the <i>real</i> student of Materia Medica, but
also to those who assume the responsibilities of editorship.</p>

<p>A third inducement, and perhaps a pardonable, is the
singular fact that much search in our literature has not enabled
me to find any assistance of the clinical application of
<i>Pothos f&#339;t.</i> by a hom&#339;opathic practitioner. If any reader
knows of any such, he will greatly gratify the writer by making
it known.</p>

<p>In dealing with authors who have gone to their reward, it
has always seemed to me a duty to give their own words as
far as possible. It brings them face to face with the reader,
and is as if one brushed the moss from their gravestones, or
perhaps, like Old Mortality, carved afresh a half-obliterated
name.</p>

<p>It is not the briefest way, but it has the merit of showing
from whence the bricks came of which the edifice is built. I
shall, then, cite the authorities in chronological order, and
copiously enough to include essentials.</p>

<p><i>Cutler.</i>&mdash;The roots dried and powdered are an excellent
medicine in asthmatic cases, and often give relief when other
means are ineffectual. It may be given with safety to
children as well as to adults; to the former, in doses of four,
five or six grains, and to the latter in doses of twenty grains
and upwards. It is given in the fit, and repeated as the case<span class="pagenum">[Pg 290]</span>
may require. This knowledge is said to have been obtained
from the Indians, who, it is likewise said, repeat the dose,
after the paroxysm (<i>sic</i>) is gone off, several mornings, then
miss as many, and repeat it again; thus continuing the
medicine until the patient is perfectly recovered. It appears
to be anti-spasmodic, and bids fair to be useful in many other
disorders.&mdash;<i>Op. cit.</i>, 1,409.</p>

<p><i>Schoepf.</i>&mdash;I am obliged to cite at second hand, as I have
never been able to find a copy of his <i>opus</i>. One may judge
of its rarity, when a foreign advertisement by a German bookseller
some years since failed to obtain it for me.</p>

<p>Prof. W. P. C. Barton, <i>op. cit.</i>, gives the gist of the Hessian
surgeon's contribution in a style and manner as prim and orderly
as that of Surgeon Schoepf himself on a dress parade.</p>

<p>"Incidens": Young reader, you must go back more than
a century to understand the "pathology" that is wrapped
up in that word like a mummy in its cerements. Don't laugh
at <i>that</i> "pathology," for some graceless graduate will laugh
at yours in 1989. Note, however, in passing, that Schoepf
says nothing, save <i>tussis</i>, that suggests the <i>vis anti-spasmodica</i>
of Cutler.</p>

<p><i>Thacher.</i>&mdash;The roots and seeds, when fresh, impart to the
mouth a sensation of pungency and acrimony similar to
Arum.</p>

<p>It may be ranked high as an anti-spasmodic, experience
having evinced that it is not inferior to the most esteemed
remedies of that class. In cases of asthmatic affections, it
alleviates the most distressing symptoms, and shortens the
duration of the paroxysms. * * * Rev. Dr. Cutler experienced
in his own particular case very considerable relief from
this medicine, after others had disappointed his expectations.
* * * The seeds of this plant are said by some to afford
more relief in asthmatic cases than the root.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 291]</span>In obstinate hysteric affections this medicine has surpassed
in efficacy all those anti-spasmodics which have generally
been employed, and in several instances it has displayed its
powers like a charm. In one of the most violent hysteric
cases I ever met with, says a correspondent, where the usual
anti-spasmodics, and even musk had failed, two teaspoonfuls
of the powdered root procured immediate relief; and on repeating
the trials with the same patient, it afforded more
lasting benefit than any other medicine. In those spasmodic
affections of the abdominal muscles during parturition, or
after delivery, this root has proved an effectual remedy. In
chronic rheumatism, and erratic pains of a spasmodic nature,
it often performs a cure, or affords essential relief.</p>

<p>It has in some cases of epilepsy suspended the fits, and
greatly alleviated the symptoms.</p>

<p>In whooping cough, and other pulmonic affections, it proves
beneficial in the form of syrup.</p>

<p>During every stage of nervous and hysteric complaints,
and in cramps and spasms, this medicine is strongly recommended
as a valuable substitute for the various anti-spasmodic
remedies commonly employed. It is free from the heating
and constipating qualities of Opium. [Yet Schoepf endowed
it with the <i>vis colifaciers</i>.]</p>

<p>Having in a few instances tested its virtues in subsultus
tendinum, attending typhus fever, its pleasing effects will encourage
the future employment of it in similar cases.</p>

<p>Two instances have been related in which this medicine
has been supposed to be remarkably efficacious in the cure of
dropsy.</p>

<p>The roots should be taken up in the autumn or spring,
before the leaves appear, and carefully dried for use. Its
strength is impaired by long keeping, especially in a powdered
state.&mdash;<i>Mat. Med.</i>, 4th ed., p. 249.</p>

<p>A young woman, about eighteen years of age, was harassed
by severe convulsive and hysteric paroxysms, almost incessantly,
insomuch that her friends estimated the number at
seven hundred in the course of a few weeks; her abdomen
was remarkably tumefied and tense, and there was a singular
bloatedness of the whole surface of her body, and the slightest
touch would occasion intolerable pain. At length her extremities
became rigid and immovable (<i>sic</i>), and her jaw was
so completely locked that she was unable to articulate, and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 292]</span>
liquids could only be introduced through the vacuity of a
lost tooth. She had been treated with a variety of anti-spasmodic
and other medicines, by an experienced physician,
without relief. Having prepared a strong infusion of the
dried root of skunk cabbage, I directed half a teacupful to
be given every few hours, without any other medicine;
the favorable effects of which were soon observable, and by
persisting in the use of it about ten days the muscular contractions
were removed, the jaw was relaxed, and her faculty
of speech and swallowing, with the use of all her limbs, were
completely effected.</p>

<p>Another young woman had been exercised with the most
distressing paroxysms of hysteria for several days, without
obtaining relief by the medicines prescribed, when the skunk
cabbage infusion was so successfully directed that her fits
were immediately arrested, and in a few days a cure was completely
effected.</p>

<p>The brother of this patient was seized with violent convulsions
of the whole body, in consequence of a cut on his
foot; the skunk cabbage was administered, and he was
speedily restored to perfect health.</p>

<p>A woman was affected with violent spasmodic pains,
twenty-four hours after parturition; six doses of skunk cabbage
entirely removed her complaints.&mdash;<i>American Modern
Practice</i>, p. 530.</p>

<p><i>Barton.</i>&mdash;The smell from spathe and flowers is pungent and
very subtle. Experience leads me to believe they possess a
great share of acridity; <i>having been seized with a very violent
inflammation of my eyes</i> (for the first time in my life),
which deprived me of the use of them for a month, by
making the original drawings of these plates. The pungency
of the plant was probably concentrated by the closeness
of the room, in which many specimens were at the time
shut up.&mdash;<i>Veg. Mat. Med.</i>, 1, 128. [The italics are not in
the original text.]</p>

<p>The seeds are said to afford more relief in asthmatic cases
than the root; and this I believe very probable, for they are
remarkably active, pungent, and, as has before been mentioned,
exhale the odor of Asaf&#339;tida.&mdash;<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 131.</p>

<p>The bruised leaves are frequently applied to ulcers and recent
wounds, and, it is said, with good effect. They are
also used as an external application in cutaneous affections;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 293]</span>
and I have heard of the expressed juice being successfully applied
to different species of herpes. The leaves are also used
in the country to dress blisters, with the view of promoting
their discharge. * * * For this purpose I can recommend
them where it is desirable to promote a large and speedy discharge,
and no stimulating ointment is at hand.</p>

<p><i>Colden</i> recommends the skunk cabbage in scurvy.&mdash;<i>Op.
cit.</i>, p. 132.</p>

<p><i>Bigelow.</i>&mdash;The odor of the Ictodes resides in a principle
which is extremely volatile. I have not been able to separate
it by distillation from any part of the plant, the decoction
and the distilled water being in my experiments but slightly
impregnated with its sensible character. Alcohol, digested
on the plant, retains its odors for a time, but this is soon dissipated
by exposure to the air.</p>

<p>An acrid principle resides in the root, even when perfectly
dry, producing an effect like that of the Arum and the
Ranunculi. When chewed in the mouth, the root is slow in
manifesting its peculiar taste; but after some moments a
pricking sensation is felt, which soon amounts to a disagreeable
smarting, and continues for some time. This acrimony
is readily dissipated by heat. The decoction retains none of
it. The distilled water is impregnated with it, if the process
be carefully conducted, but loses it on standing a short time.&mdash;<i>Amer.
Med. Bot.</i>, 2, 45.</p>

<p>To insure a tolerably uniform activity of this medicine, the
root should be kept in dried slices, and not reduced to powder
until it is wanted for use.&mdash;<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 49.</p>

<p>A number of cases have fallen under my own observation
of the catarrhal affections of old people, in which a syrup
prepared from the root in substance has alleviated and removed
the complaint.&mdash;<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 48.</p>

<p>In delicate stomachs I have found it frequently to occasion
vomiting even in a small quantity. In several cases of gastrodynia,
where it was given with a view to its anti-spasmodic
effect, it was ejected from the stomach more speedily than
common cathartic medicines. I have known it in a dose of
thirty grains to bring on not only vomiting, but headache
(<i>sic</i>), vertigo and temporary blindness.&mdash;<i>Op. cit.</i>, pp. 48-49.</p>

<p><i>Hand.</i>&mdash;The root is a pungent anti-spasmodic in colics and
griping of the bowels.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>Leaves bruised relieve painful swellings, whitlows, etc.&mdash;<i>House
Surg. and Phys.</i>, p. 250.</p>

<p><i>Eberle.</i>&mdash;In chronic cough attended with a cold, phlegmatic
habit of body, I have employed the powdered root of
this plant with the most decided benefit. In an old man who
had been for many years afflicted with a very troublesome
cough and difficulty of breathing, I found nothing to give so
much relief as this substance.</p>

<p>In cases of chronic catarrhal and asthmatic affections, and
very generally with evident advantage.&mdash;<i>Mat. Med. and
Thur.</i>, 2, 154.</p>

<p><i>Ives.</i>&mdash;The root loses its pungent taste, and appears to be
nearly inert in a few weeks after it is gathered. I prepared,
however, an alcoholic extract some years ago, by digesting
the fresh roots and evaporating the tincture in the sun, which
possessed and retained all the acrimony of the recent root.
The fresh leaves are actively rubefacient.&mdash;<i>Pharmacologia</i>,
p. 147.</p>

<p><i>Smith.</i>&mdash;Skunk cabbage is not only a good anti-spasmodic
in all cases where such are indicated, but it is also a powerful
emmenagogue, anthelmintic, and a valuable remedy in dropsy,
in spasms, rheumatism, palpitations, etc. It is frequently
used in childbed to promote the birth. * * * * For
expelling worms, the pulverized root should be administered
in molasses for a sufficient length of time, following it up
with a purge.&mdash;<i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 511.</p>

<p><i>Rafinesque.</i>&mdash;Powerful anti-spasmodic, expectorant, incisive,
vermifuge, menagogue, sudorific, etc. Used with success
in spasmodic asthmas and coughs, hysterics, pertussis,
epilepsy, dropsy, scurvy, chronic rheumatism, erradic and
spasmodic pains, parturition, amenorrh&#339;a, worms, etc.&mdash;<i>Op.
cit.</i>, 2, 230.</p>

<p>The difficulty of breathing is better in the open air.</p>

<p>Pain in the crest of the right tibia.</p>

<p>Rheumatic troubles increased.</p>

<p>Sleepy early in the evening.</p>

<p>All troubles disappear in the open air.</p>

<p>In attempting to analyze this "abstract of symptoms," to
see if the internal evidence tends to show that the recorded
effects are genuine results of the drug, it is well to remember
that these provings&mdash;for we infer that three observers
participated therein&mdash;were made in the light of the empirical
history of <i>Pothos f&#339;t.</i> The said history was on record
before the date of these provings, and it cannot have escaped
Hering's eye; he was too wide a reader for that. He was,
beyond doubt, aware of the pathogenetic effects observed by
Bigelow&mdash;<i>headache</i>, <i>vertigo</i>, <i>temporary blindness</i>, <i>vomiting</i>,
<i>even from small quantities</i>. Having, then, this clue to its
physiological action, these symptoms should reappear in his
proving <i>if his imagination furnished his symptoms</i>. As only
a mild headache is noted in the <i>Correspondenzblatt</i>, it is evident
that these provers did not <i>work from a pattern</i>. It is
also evident that the <i>usus in morbis</i> did not suggest the Allentown
symptomatology, for the anti-asthmatic virtue of <i>Pothos
f&#339;t.</i> is one feature on which the greatest stress had been laid,
and yet the only <i>pathogenetic</i> suggestion of its applicability
in asthma is: "<i>Sudden feeling of anxiety with difficult</i> (or
oppressed) respiration and sweat, followed by stool and the
<i>subsidence of these and other pains</i>." Who ever heard of an<span class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</span>
asthma relieved by stool? Who could have <i>invented</i> such
an odd modality? As it stands it is an <i>unicum</i>, and by every
rule of criticism this single symptom-group gives the stamp
of verity to the Allentown "abstract of symptoms." But
there is other and singularly convincing evidence of the genuineness
of this abstract. As the reader is aware, Thacher
had emphasized the efficiency of <i>Pothos f&#339;t.</i> as an anti-spasmodic
in hysteria, although the "key-note" that indicates it
in hysteria had wholly escaped his discernment.</p>

<p>Now this very "key-note" appears in the Allentown pathogenesis,
but so unobtrusively as to show most conclusively
that the prover who furnished it did not recognize its singular
import and value. Such testimony is absolutely unimpugnable
by honest and intelligent criticism.</p>

<p>It is also apparent that some of the less pronounced of its
empirical virtues are reflected in the proving. For instance,
Thacher found it efficacious in "erratick pains of a spasmodick
nature." Is not this "erratic" feature reproduced in
such conditions as:</p>

<p>"Headache, of brief duration, in single spots, now here,
now there?"</p>

<p>"Pressure in both temples alternately, harder on one side
than on the other?"</p>

<p>"Bellyache, here and there, in single spots?"</p>

<p>Brevity of duration and recurrence "in single spots, now
here, now there," are phenomena at once <i>spasmodic</i> and
<i>erratic</i>. It must be admitted that the trend of its pathogenetic
action and the lines of its therapeutical application are
parallel, and, therefore, that the latter are confirmatory of the
former.</p>

<p>With such an anti-hysterical reputation as the empirical
use had given to <i>Pothos f&#339;t.</i>, it might fairly be anticipated
that its pathogenesis would be distinguished by a paucity of
objective <i>data</i>, for only a tyro in pharmacodynamics, or a
"Regular," would expect to find a full-lined picture of
hysteria in any "proving." And so we have in the "ab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>stract"
a flux of subjective symptoms, "erratic" enough for
hysterical elements, and still further characterized by an apparent
evanescence, as if its phenomena of sensory disturbance
were as fleeting and unsubstantial as those of an hysterical
storm.</p>

<p>The <i>will-o'-the-wisp-like</i> character of its subjective symptoms,
and its physometric property (hinted at in the pathogenesis
and emphasized in Thacher's case) are the features that will
chiefly impress one in studying this distinctively American
remedy.</p>

<p>That the "abstract of symptomes" evinces a cautious trial
of this drug, and that more heroic experiments will add to
our knowledge of its pathogenetic properties, are plain deductions
from the absence in the "abstract" of such pronounced
effects as Bigelow observed and also from the evidence of the
<i>usus in morbis</i>. The remedy needs an efficient proving, especially
in the female organism.</p>

<p>Miss B&mdash;&mdash;, æt. 20; a tall, spare brunette, and a good
specimen of Fothergill's <i>Arab type</i>, brainy and vivacious.
General health has been good, but she was never robust;
could not go to school regularly. Between her thirteenth
and fifteenth years grew rapidly in stature, and then she was
easily wearied on walking; knees tired and limbs ached.
Had good digestion through the growing period, but subsequently
became subject to "bloat of wind" in abdomen.
These meteoristic attacks came when lying down. A "weight
rises from the abdomen up to the heart." She must at once
spring up. This condition is relieved by eructating, by
liquor, and by drinking hot water. The night attacks of
meteorism are by far the worst. <i>She is now subject to them.</i></p>

<p>[Her grand-mother had such "spells of bloating;" would
spring out of bed at night, lose consciousness, and "bloat up
suddenly." If she had such an attack when dressed, they had
often been obliged to cut open her clothes.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 300]</span>Patient has found that apples, tomatoes, cabbage and onions
disagree with her; no other food. She is constipated&mdash;"wants
to and can't."</p>

<p>Her hair is unusually dry; scalp full of dandruff; skin,
generally, soft and flexible.</p>

<p>She has frequent epistaxis; has had four and five attacks a
day. Blood bright red, "runs a perfect stream," does not clot
at the nostrils. Has previously a "heavy feeling" in the
head, which the bleeding relieves.</p>

<p>In appearance she is "the picture of health;" good complexion,
fairly ruddy cheeks, sparkling eyes&mdash;in a word, she
is an incarnated protest against "single blessedness."</p>

<p>In the latter part of July, 1886, had her first "fit." She
had arisen with a headache, which kept on increasing in
severity. Just after a light meal had the attack; "Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!" and fell insensible. Stiffened at first, then had
clonic spasms. Neither bit the tongue nor frothed at the
mouth. No micturition or defecation. On coming to, did not
remember that she had fallen, but recollected being borne up
stairs. Had a "dreadful nosebleed" after the attack. Left
her very weak; could hardly lift her feet from the floor.
Before the "fit" the headache had become unbearably severe.</p>

<p>Had her second "fit" on August 7th, 1887. Headache
came on and kept growing worse; was in temples, beating
and throbbing, and in eyes, "light hurt"&mdash;also on vertex,
"pressing-down" pain. At 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> suddenly fell down insensible.
No cry. Tongue bitten. Slight frothing at the mouth.
First "stiff all over," then clonic spasms. After the "fit"
knew that something had happened to her. Was prostrated
for nearly a month, but not so much as after first attack.</p>

<p>December 10th, 1887, third "fit." On the night of the 9th
her mother had been very ill, and she herself was very uneasy
and alarmed. Had the attack before breakfast. Blurred
vision, headache, fall; no biting of tongue, nor frothing.
First rigid, then clonic spasms; after attack, nose bled profusely,
head ached all day, face flushed and dark. Prostrated
as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 301]</span>In none of the attacks was there any involuntary micturition
or defecation, nor was it ever necessary to use any force
to hold her on the bed.</p>

<p>One other fact I gathered from her brother, namely: during
her "fits" her abdomen bloated so rapidly and to such a
degree that the family had learned to remove her clothing as
soon as possible after she fell.</p>

<p>Of course, Thacher's case, wherein the "abdomen was remarkably
tumefied and tense," came into memory at once.
The old volume was taken down, and that case re-read. Then
followed the <i>Encyclopædia</i>, and then the English <i>Symptomen
Codex</i>. No pathogenetic light or corroboration <i>there</i>. Then
Curie's "Jahr." Ah! "<i>Inflation and tension in the abdomen.</i>"
Only a straw, but a pathogenetic, and I grasped it thankfully.
I found also, "<i>aching in the temples with violent arterial
pulsation</i>."</p>

<p>It was an open winter; my son dug some skunk cabbage
roots in a swamp; a tincture was made; ten-drop doses, four
times daily, were taken until six ounces had been consumed.</p>

<p>No "fit" up to date; no epistaxis; only once a slight headache.</p>

<p>I never made a diagnosis in this case; have not reached one
yet, nor am I grieving over that omission. I did rashly
declare that it was not epilepsy, because Sauvages <i>tympanites
intestinalis</i> is a feature of hysteria, but not of epilepsy. But
not a word of this was said to the patient. It was not a
"mind cure," for I have no "mind" to spare; nor was it
"Christian science," for I am not up to that. I had an
<i>amnesis</i> in which grand-mother and grand-daughter participated.
Nature had put the "key-note" in italics, not only in
the patient but also in the drug. Thacher stumbled upon it
empirically; Hering found it pathogenetically, and that led
to its application under the guidance of the only approximation
to <i>a law</i> in therapeutics that has yet been discovered by
any of woman born: <i>similia similibus curantur</i>!</p>

same journal:)</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pothos F&#339;tida, Hysteria.</span></p>

<p>November 6, 1889, was called in haste to see Miss N&mdash;&mdash;,
aged 19 years. Found her lying upon the floor, exhibiting
all the phenomena of epilepsy, clenched hands, frothing at
the mouth, clonic spasm, etc.</p>

<p>On questioning the family, I learned that she had been subject
to such seizures for about two years, and that they were
increasing in frequency. She had been dismissed from the
various cotton mills in which she had been employed because
of them. The father had been informed that she had epilepsy,
and she had been treated accordingly by three old
school physicians.</p>

<p>The sister informed me that although she had frequently
fallen near the stove she had never struck it. Further questioning
elicited the fact of her never having injured herself
more seriously than to bite her tongue. It was then I became
suspicious, and later felt convinced that it was hysteria
and not epilepsy with which I had to deal.</p>

<p>I remembered having read in <i>The Recorder</i> an article by
Dr. S. A. Jones, of Ann Arbor, on <i>Pothos f&#339;tida</i>, with the
record of a case in some respects similar to mine. After
again reading it up, I made a tincture of the roots and tendrils
gathered at the time, of which I gave her a two drachm
phial, directing her to take ten drops three times per day.</p>

<p>On the second day she had a slight seizure while at dinner.
After two months she again resumed her place in the mill,
where she has since been steadily employed, and is strong and
well in every way.</p>

<p>Have used <i>Pothos</i> in epilepsy, also in dropsy, with negative
results.</p>

characteristic of the <i>Arsenicum</i> eruption, also of <i>Anacardium</i>,
<i>Rhus tox.</i>, and some others. The eruption also bears a strong
resemblance to these remedies, and if one may judge from the
symptoms enumerated ought to prove a potent rival in erysipelas
and eczematous complaints. <i>Rhus</i> poisoning will no
doubt find a new and efficient remedy in <i>Primula</i>.</p>

<p>My memory of details, never remarkable, except as the details
belonged to some system, is not as good as in earlier life,
and in the matter of disconnected or partially connected in<span class="pagenum">[Pg 306]</span>cidents,
the widow Bedott could, at any time, have given me
five points in ten, and then have beaten me easily.</p>

<p>No. 1 of the provers was a married lady; No. 2 and No. 3
were lads. The tincture of the bark was used, several drops
being put in a cup of water, of which teaspoonful doses were
given and repeated at, I do not remember what, intervals.
Myself experienced some irritation of the eyes; no other
symptoms.</p>

<p>No. 1. Feels like crying. Feels as if the knees are immensely
swollen, as if the toes the same. Knees and toes
ache. Feels constricted around the waist, obliged to loosen
the clothes at once. Headache begins over the eyes, left side
of head aches terribly, like a tooth ache. Aches everywhere,
in every joint. Left great toe feels as if torn from the
socket. Sense of prolapsus of womb, bearing down and
pressing out, as if swollen, and burning all over. Pains in
the head knife-like. All the pains intense, acute. Thinks
the conditions that of inflammatory rheumatism as if the
lungs were congested, especially at the base. Can hardly
breathe, as if cold water in the stomach. Thinks mucus
accumulated in the cold stomach. Craves hot teas. Headache
extends to the right side. Head feels as if it would
burst. Great weight on top of head. Toes burn. Aching
at heart. Twinging pains in arms, legs and toes. As if
rectum were shrunken, dried up. Bearing down pains and
pressing out, like labor pains. Feels gloomy and discouraged,
but can't cry. Very cold, shivers internally; thinks she
must look blue. Cold creeping all over. Pain in knees subsides,
and is succeeded by pain as in the tendons and along
the calves. "Oh, such a drawing pain, cutting and darting
also, like that in the head." Feels resolute, as full of a
gloomy determination. Stomach cold again. Thinks meat
bad for her, would not digest; needs soft, mild food. Irritation
of bladder and urethra; feels as if prolapsus of bladder.
Dreads to move, especially on account of the joints. Sensitive
to cold. Stomach still feels as if full of cold water.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 307]</span>
Sick feeling under right scapula. Thinks bile deficient.
Shooting pains in forehead. Feeling as if coldness in
stomach extends up under the sternum. Same feeling in the
gullet. Excessive aching of bones of toes; seems unendurable.
Thinks the stomach very weak, as if it would digest
nothing; thinks it is dry and wrinkled. Hypochondriac, not
nervous. Feels lazy, as if she would like to lie in bed and
be waited on. Selfish. Headache penetrating in temples.
Thinks she is clairvoyant, can read character and understand
motions; can see into herself; thinks the blood dark blue.
Feels pains drawing, rending along posterior aspect of thighs
and down to toes. Left side most affected. Feels as if the
left leg were drawn up, and would never straighten again.
Pains seem to move in meandering lines. Seems to be able
to go out of herself for a short distance, to walk around and
return into the body. Thinks she is looking down upon her
own body. Seems to her that the fundus of the stomach is
depressed in the abdomen, as if on fire at the pyloric end of
stomach. Thinks there is a red spot there, looking like raw
beef, as if the stomach burnt up with raw whisky. Exclaims
in a plaintive tone, "Don't get out of patience with me" (of
which I had given no indications). Cries, feels babyish. Apprehension;
fears something terrible is about to occur. Very
chilly. Can't talk loud; voice gone. She feels so weak, as
if about to die. Moans and groans, calls for help. Oppression
about the heart, as if it had stopped beating, as going
into convulsions. Feels as if a spasm of the heart, tetanic.
As if the blood too thick to circulate. Thinks she would
have died but for the <i>Camphor</i> I gave her. Felt as she did
when near dying of hemorrhage. Brain is active, intellect
clear, thoughts vivid, the whole being intensified. Next
morning, sense of constriction at base of lungs. Some cough.
Clammy feeling of skin. Very sensitive to air.</p>

<p>No. 2. Causes a glow all over, hands sweat. Some pain
in finger joints. Throat feels obstructed. Some hoarseness.
Dry cough, as if pharynx stuffed with cotton. It is an effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
to talk. Tongue feels partially paralyzed, cannot direct it.
Throws the paper down, has lost inclination to read. Feels
indolent, indifferent. Feels chills when air strikes. Spasmodic
breathing, like a nervous woman&mdash;silly, mystical.
Pain in finger joints continues. Feels like crying. Sad,
weeping mood. Tears will come. Eyes smart. Heart aches,
as from some great sorrow. Eyes feel as if had been crying
a long time, as if swollen, burning. Very sensitive to cold,
easily chilled. Chills down the back and both legs. Ends
with a very tranquil feeling, particularly of consciousness.
Next morning, tight feeling of patella. Joints all feel constricted
and sore.</p>

<p>No. 3. Very chilly. Can't endure cold at all. Other symptoms
not recorded.</p>

<p>In all three, pains and chilliness much increased by moving
about.</p>

<p>No. 1. Subsequently her muscular condition was much improved.
Her muscles did not ache from work as formerly.</p>

<p>A cut bled less freely than usual, bled scarcely any, and
healed very quickly.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. John Fearns writes of this remedy in <i>Chicago Medical Times</i>, 1896:)</p></blockquote>

<p>At this writing I wish to speak not of the tonic and antiseptic
properties of this species of <i>Salix</i>, but of its usefulness
as a sedative to the generative system. As a sedative on these
lines I have had very good results from its use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>In cases of acute gonorrh&#339;a with much errotic trouble.
Also in cases of chordee with great irritation; for these purposes
I have given it in doses of thirty to sixty drops on retiring,
and repeat at midnight or towards morning, if needed;
in these cases nothing has given me more satisfaction than
this remedy. It answers the purpose, it robs night of its
terrors, and it leaves no unpleasant consequences in its train.</p>

<p>In cases of excessive venereal desire, amounting to satyriasis,
from experience I would use this remedy first. I have
seen it control the venereal appetite in a very satisfactory
manner. It can be given in cases where the bromides have
always been considered appropriate, and it can be given where
the bromides would be very inappropriate and there is no reflex
effect on the brain or nervous system.</p>

<h3>SALVIA OFFICINALIS.</h3>

<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Common sage.<br />
<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The fresh leaves are macerated in twice their
weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Although scarcely used in the present day sage runs back in medical history
to the Greeks, and, according to Fernie, is still held in the highest
esteem by country people in many parts of Europe. Quoting Gerard: "Sage
is singularly good for the head and brain; it quickeneth the senses and
memory; strengtheneth the sinews; restoreth health to those that have palsy;
and takes away shaky trembling of the members." The following appeared
in <i>Echo Med. du Nord</i>, 1897, concerning this remedy:)</p></blockquote>

<p>This remedy (in English, <i>Sage</i>) has been almost forgotten
in modern medical art, but still remains in high repute as a
domestic medicine. Lately, French physicians have called
attention to it, and not only for gargling in cases of inflammation
of the throat and for washing the mouth in affections
of the gums, but more especially as an unfailing remedy for
night-sweats in persons suffering from affections of the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>spiratory
organs. In the numerous experiments made with
it, there were never any disagreeable concomitant effects. On
the contrary, it was found that <i>Salvia</i> acts even more favorably
on the tickling coughs with consumptives than <i>Belladonna</i>,
<i>Rumex crispus</i>, etc., so that preparations of <i>Morphine</i>
and <i>Codeine</i> could be dispensed with.</p>

<p><i>Salvia</i> should be used in the form of the tincture, and,
indeed, the tincture prepared from the fresh leaves and
the blossom tips, as we find it in hom&#339;opathic pharmacies.
It should be given in doses of 20, 30, or 40 drops, in a tablespoonful

quickly, two hours after taking a dose, and these effects persist
for two to six days.</p>

<p>Readers who are interested in the remedies of nature rather
than those produced in the laboratory and sold under trademarks
will remember that it was Dr. D. L. Phares, of Mississippi,
who, over half a century ago, pointed out the wonderful
virtues of <i>Passiflora incarnata</i>, so much used to-day. What
Dr. Phares said of the remedy laid dormant until Hale, in his
ever perennial <i>New Remedies</i>, rescued it from the dusty
pages of old medical journals, in which so much of value is
buried awaiting resurrection. Among such buried remedies
is <i>Saururus cernuus</i> or, as it is more commonly known,
"lizard's tail." Dr. Phares, who seems to have been an
unusually keen observer, used <i>Saururus cer.</i> in his practice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
as he did <i>Passiflora</i>, for many years before he communicated
his observations to the medical journals, and the <i>Saururus</i>
seems to be quite as important and useful a remedy in its
sphere as is <i>Passiflora</i>, and one quite as worthy of a thorough
proving. In absence of proving it may be said that Dr.
Phares used it for years with marked success in all irritation
and inflammation of the kidneys, bladder, prostate and urinary
passages. He considered it peculiarly adapted to all such
cases if they were attended by strangury, or painful and difficult
urination. Dr. Phares used the remedy both externally
and internally and he found that the stomach was very tolerant
of the rather heroic doses he prescribed.</p>

<p>The plant is an indigenous perennial found in swampy
localities, in some parts of the United States, and has been,
and is still, used in domestic practice for those conditions for
which Dr. Phares commends it.</p>

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The fresh root is macerated in twice its weight
of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. W. U. Reed, of Northmanchester, Ind., contributed the following in
1892 to the <i>Hom. Recorder</i>, concerning this little known remedy. <i>Sisyrinchium</i>
was one of the old "Thompsonians." From what Dr. Reed says of
it the remedy must be a very powerful one and worthy of full investigation.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Numerous articles have appeared in our medical journals
during the past few months relative to the treatment of persons
bitten by venomous reptiles, especially the rattlesnake.
Whether the rattlesnakes found in the marshes of Indiana are
in any respect different from those found in Oregon, or in the
mountains of Pennsylvania, I do not know. The bite of the
Indiana rattler has been known to prove fatal to both man
and beast. Notwithstanding we have growing in our woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
and fields a small plant, which I believe to be a specific for
the treatment of persons or animals bitten by the rattlesnake.
From my own experience and observation in the use of this
remedy, I believe it to be a positive cure in all cases if exhibited
in any reasonable time. I have never known it to
fail in a single instance, even where the alcoholic treatment
and many other kinds had failed.</p>

<p>The plant referred to, the roots of which are used in the
treatment of snake bites; or a tincture made from the roots,
is the <i>Sisyrinchium</i> of the <i>Iris</i> family, I think, and is said to
have been used by the Indians in treating snake bites, by
bruising and moistening the roots and applying to the wound.
I am not aware of its ever having been used as a medicine by
the profession, and, so far as I know, I am the first to prepare
and use it in the form of a tincture. By your kind permission
I will report, through the columns of your valuable
journal, a few cases treated by this remedy, which for convenience
I will call <i>Sisyrinchium</i>.</p>

<p>Case 1. Bessie A., aged six years, while playing in the yard
on a farm, some twelve miles in the country, was bitten in
the hand by a rattlesnake which was killed a moment after
by the mother of the little girl who was attracted by the
screams of the child. Sixteen hours after I arrived, everything
having been done in the meantime that had ever been
heard of by the parents, even to poulticing the wound with
entrails of a black chicken. The little sufferer was, indeed,
an object of pity. The hand and arm were swollen almost
to bursting, the swelling extending to the shoulder and spine,
being of a bluish black color as if dreadfully bruised. This
discoloration extended over the back to the hips. Skin hot
and dry, face flushed, pulse quick and hard. Child unconscious.
I felt that the case was hopeless. But through the
earnest entreaties of the mother, I proceeded to do what I
could. Saturating a piece of cotton with the tincture I had
prepared, I bound it on the wound; then dropping twelve
drops in a glass of water I directed that a teaspoonful be<span class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</span>
given every hour, the compress to be renewed every hour
also, until my return. I confess I had little hope of seeing
my little patient alive again, but on my return the following
day I was much rejoiced to find a decided change for the better
in the condition of the little sufferer. The swelling was
not nearly so tense, the fever had subsided, the delirium gone,
and the danger seemed past. The treatment was continued,
and a speedy and permanent recovery followed.</p>

<p>Case 2. Burt Whitten, aged ten, while out in a marsh with
a number of older boys gathering huckleberries, was bitten
in the right ankle by a rattler. He was so frightened when
he saw the snake, as it bit him, that he ran all the way home,
a distance of nearly a mile; although the day was very hot.
This patient came to my hands after the usual alcoholic
treatment for twenty-four hours by an Allopathic physician,
with the patient growing worse all the time. I found this
patient in about the same condition as the first. The leg and
foot were enormously swollen and of the same general appearance;
the foot, calf of the leg and thigh were black; the
whole body was very red, hot and dry; face dark red; pulse
quick and hard; patient delirious but would cry out if
touched. Fifteen drops in a glass of water. Teaspoonful
every hour, with cotton saturated with the tincture applied to
the wound. In this case the change, I was informed by the
father, was quite noticeable in two hours. The boy had
been in a wild delirium all night and up to the time he received
the first dose of <i>Sisyrinchium</i>. After the second dose
he became quiet, and in two hours the delirium had passed
away. Under this treatment the patient was able to be out
on the streets again in four days, though the discoloration did
not disappear for some time after.</p>

<p>Many more cases might be given where this remedy has
been given to both man and beast with the same results.</p>

<p>The lake has no outlet, but is fed by two enormous
springs. It contains no living things with the exception of
axolotl, a kind of salamander, such as are found in the lakes
of the Mexican Cordilleras.</p>

<p>The medical and curative properties of this remarkable
lake was known to the Indians of the northwest as far back
as they have any legends or tribal history, and it was held in
such reverence by them that the country around this lake was
called 'Sahala Lyee Illihe,' or 'Sacred Grounds,' and no
matter how hostile the tribes were to each other no Indians
journeying to or from the 'Skookum Limechen Chuck,' or
'strong medicine water,' were ever molested.</p>

<p>When the Indians were considering the transfer of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
lands to the government, many years ago, it is recorded as a
matter of history, that old Quetahlguin, father of the present
Chief Moses, and 'Old Joseph,' father of Chief Joseph, lately
a prisoner of war, with the broken remnants of his band, after
weeks of deliberation and consideration, with the 'Sahala
Lyee,' or Great Spirit, through their medicine-men, or
prophets, firmly said: 'We have talked with the Great Spirit
and we have slept with his words in our ears. The Great
Spirit is our father and the earth is our mother. We have a
good home and it was made for us by the Great Spirit; it is
a part of us; it is our mother. In Wallowa Lake are an
abundance of fish created especially for our tribe. None
other of his red children have such fish. In the 'Skookum
Chuck' we have a remedy for all our ailments. We only
have to bathe in and drink its water and we are made well.
If we sign the treaty we will forever offend the Great Spirit;
we will sign away our mother and she will cry. Her tears
will dry up these lakes and we will be hungry and sick. We
will go to the Skookum Chuck only to find that its waters
have disappeared.'</p>

<p>The story is told of a Frenchman passing the lake many
years ago, before the properties of the water became known to
the whites, with a drove of sheep afflicted with a skin disease
called 'the scab.' As soon as the sheep saw the water they
ran to it, but would not drink. They stood in the water for
some time, and in a few days they were well of the 'scab.'
The Frenchman was suffering with rheumatism. He concluded
to try the water of the lake for his disease. He was
speedily cured. The whites were soon attracted to this lake
by the stories of marvellous cures reported by the Indians,
and by seeing Indians return in health and vigor from the
lake, who had been taken there on litters, appearing at the
point of death. It is estimated that over 20,000 people have
visited this lake since 'Joseph's Band' were driven from that
section of the country, and it is fast becoming as popular as
any other of our great health resorts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>My attention was called to <i>Skookum chuck</i> some time
since, and I procured some of the salts and triturated a quantity,
making the first, second, third and sixth potencies. I
partially proved the first potency by taking two grains every
two hours. The first effect produced was a profuse coryza
with constant sneezing, as in hay fever. This continued
until the medicine was antidoted by tobacco. My appetite
was greatly increased. Some rheumatic pains in limbs, and
heaviness about the sacrum. The catarrhal effects were so
severe I could not continue the remedy. I have used the
third and sixth potency in my practice and have cured a
number of cases of catarrh, and am confident that the remedy
will be curative in hay fever.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Later investigation, however, demonstrated that the chief curative action
of the salts was in skin diseases. Dr. D. De Forest Cole, of Albion, N. Y.,
wrote the following to the firm from whom he procured the remedy:)</p></blockquote>

<p>Some time since I received from you one bottle <i>Skookum
chuck</i> 3x trit. I had a very bad case of urticaria which resisted
the usual remedies as <i>Apis</i>, <i>Urtica ur.</i>, etc., and I gave
her (a girl twelve years old) four powders of about four
grains each of the <i>Skookum chuck</i>, instructing her to take one
powder in one-half glass water, one teaspoonful every two
hours, and she returned in a week free from any urticaria. I
gave her four powders more, and no appearance of urticaria
since. Besides curing the urticaria the patient's health is in
every way improving. I write this thinking you might desire
to know of its value in urticaria, as well as eczema.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following cases were contributed by Dr. D. W. Ingalls, Bridgeport,

<p><span class="smcap">Case</span> 1. Mrs. D., aged forty-eight years, suffered four years
with eczema plantaris, fissured, red and painful, which gave
forth a viscid secretion, drying into scales half an inch in
thickness. For the past two years the patient had not been
able to wear shoes nor walk any distance, owing to the excessive
soreness of the feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>Patient consulted me March 1st, and the following treatment
was given: Two-grain powders of the 2x trituration of
<i>Skookum chuck</i> every two hours, and an ointment applied
nightly consisting of <i>Skookum salt</i>, one drachm to the ounce
of <i>Vaseline</i>. In the morning the feet were washed with
<i>Skookum chuck</i> soap. April 1st the patient walked to the
dispensary in felt shoes. The fissures and greenish tinge of
the crusts had nearly disappeared. The two-grain powders
were then given every four hours and the former treatment
continued. On May 1st, patient walked to the dispensary
wearing leather shoes for the first time, the ointment was
stopped, the fissures and crevices being hardly perceptible.
The patient was advised to wash the feet night and morning

<p>June 1st patient presented herself, stating that she had very
little trouble with her feet, except some tenderness upon a
misstep. Appearance good.</p>

<p>A powder of the 3x was given every night, together with
the continued washing of the feet night and morning. July

four times a day, together with the <i>Skookum</i> ointment applied
nightly. This case was entirely cured in six weeks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case</span> 3. Mrs. H., aged twenty-three, benign growth in
left breast about the size of a walnut; first noticed about eight
months previously. Upon strict inquiry, no history of cancer
or tuberculosis was given. One-grain powders of the 1x were
given, the first week every four hours. Two-grain powders
of the 2x were given every four hours the second week. Five-grain
powders of the 3x were given the third week and continued
seven weeks, when the patient was discharged cured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case</span> 4. Mr. S. was afflicted with eczema of the scalp,
which spread from back of the ears to the eyebrows, covering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
the entire scalp with a squamous or scabby eczema, accompanied
with a constant itching and shedding of scales. On
March 18th the following treatment was given: Head to be
washed four times a day with <i>Skookum chuck</i> soap. A five-grain
powder 2x trituration was given every hour during the
first week, when <i>Sulphur</i>, third decimal, was given for three
days, and <i>Skookum chuck</i>, second decimal, was continued for
one week. One-grain powder of the 1x was given in water
four times a day for two weeks; then the third decimal
trituration was used until June 1st, when patient was discharged
cured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case</span> 5. Mr. J., nasal catarrh, of years' standing. A greenish-yellow
discharge having the odor of a slight oz&#339;na. The
patient had been so much relieved that he is at present writing
very comfortable, and believes that he will be permanently
cured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Case</span> 6. Mrs. D., aged thirty-six, prolonged suppuration
due to abscess of the axilla; nine months' standing. June
20th the following treatment was given: The abscess was
washed four times a day with the solution of <i>Skookum</i> salts,
five grains to one quart of water, and the 2x given internally
every two hours until July 10th, when the abscess was healed.
A two-grain powder was then continued, night and morning
for one month, with no return of the abscess. To sum up, I
have simply verified what Dr. Gentry and others have given
us about the remedy. I have used it with gratifying success
in all suppurating wounds. It evidently has a great sphere of
action, and I hope some day to see a good proving.</p>

<p>We have many remedies brought to our notice in an
empirical way, which soon lose their prominence, first because
we have no provings, and second, having no provings,
clinical study is not close enough. When <i>Skookum chuck</i>
was first written up, I began to use it and watch its effects, that
it might be possible to find its proper niche in practice. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
following two cases will, I think, give an idea of the cases in
which it may always be depended upon:</p>

<p>Case No. 1.&mdash;A married woman of 40 years of age. History
and present condition show a lithæmic diathesis. For years
has never been free from eczematous troubles. At times
suffers much from rheumatism, not infrequently, rheumatism
disappears to be immediately followed by hordeoli upon eyelids.
Has been treated long and faithfully by Allopaths, and
now for some years by our own school. Prescribed <i>Skookum</i>
3x&mdash;one powder every 4 hours. Improvement was soon
evident. Persisted in this treatment for three months, and
now for two years patient has been perfectly well.</p>

<p>Case No. 2.&mdash;Patient, married woman of about 26 years,
comes to me with urine, sp. grav. 1.030, marked uric acid
deposits, flushed face upon a yellowish background&mdash;so often
seen in lithæmic cases. Much difficulty of digestion. Great
dryness of skin, especially of scalp, with great trouble from
falling out of hair&mdash;in short a thoroughly lithæmic case.
<i>Skookum chuck</i> 3x every four hours. Satisfactory improvement.
Has feared head will become entirely bald. Now no
loss of hair, and a loss of the heated, congested feeling of
face and head. In fact, a satisfactory recovery now of some
weeks standing. These cases briefly stated ought to be of
interest, in that they show it to be probable that we will find
the sphere of action of <i>Skookum</i> to be in lithæmic cases, and
for the treatment of these cases we have but a few clearly
defined reliable remedies.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In 1889 Dr. Napier called attention to <i>Solanum Carolinense</i> as a remedy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>in the treatment of epilepsy, stating that it was used as a domestic remedy
in the South for convulsions and "that he had successfully prescribed it in
his practice." Dr. Charles S. Potts, of the University of Pennsylvania, contributes
a paper <i>Therap. Gazette</i>, Dec., 1895, on the remedy, giving some
new points, from which the following is condensed:)</p></blockquote>

<p>At the clinic for nervous diseases of the University Hospital,
<i>Solanum Carolinense</i> was tried in a series of twenty-five
cases, twenty-one of which were idiopathic, three organic,
and one probably so. Of these, eight of the idiopathic cases
either did not return after the first visit or else were not under
observation sufficiently long to offer a fair test. In the remaining
seventeen cases the following results were obtained&mdash;viz.,
five, two of them organic, were not improved. In the
remaining twelve the results showed more or less benefit from
the use of the drug. The five cases in which no improvement
was noted were afterwards placed upon other treatment,
either antipyrin and bromide of ammonium or the mixed
bromides with amelioration of the symptoms in four; in the
remaining one no drug seemed to be of service. The dose
used at first was 10 drops. This dose was found to be useless,
and after the first few cases they varied from 30 drops to
teaspoonful three or four times daily. No unpleasant effects
were observed, excepting a mild diarrh&#339;a in some cases.
This was also noticed by Dr. Herdman. He also noticed that
in large doses the temperature was lowered and the pulse
slowed.</p>

<p>In many epileptics diarrh&#339;a is more of a benefit than otherwise.</p>

<p>The conclusions derived from the results obtained in seventeen
cases are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the drug has a decided influence for good upon the
epileptic paroxysm.</p>

<p>2. That this influence is probably not so great or so sure as
that obtained by the use of antipyrin and the bromide salts or
even of the mixed bromides.</p>

<p>3. That in those cases in which it is of service it relieves
the paroxysms, without causing any other unpleasant symp<span class="pagenum">[Pg 323]</span>toms,
such as are sometimes caused by the use of large doses
of the bromides.</p>

<p>4. That the dose ordinarily recommended is too small, and
that as much as a teaspoonful or more four times daily is often
needed to secure results.</p>

<p>The following are some of the cases in which the remedy
seemed to act beneficially:</p>

<p>H. T., male, aged thirteen years. Idiopathic epilepsy; had
his first spell when five years of age; averages one paroxysm
daily. The <i>Solanum</i> was first given in 10 drop doses <i>t. i. d.</i>
without effect. When increased to 25 drops the spells were
lighter in severity, but occurred about as often. The dose
was finally increased to a teaspoonful four times daily. After
being put upon this dose he was under observation six weeks,
during which time he had six seizures much lighter in
severity.</p>

<p>T. H., male, aged twenty-eight years. He had epileptic
seizures for the past three years. They followed an injury to
the head which rendered him unconscious, but produced no
other visible injury. Since this, however, has had almost
constant headache. First spell six month after the injury,
and have been very frequent since, averaging three to four
weekly; they are of ordinary type. <i>Solanum</i> in 40 drop
doses three times daily was ordered. Spells at once decreased
in frequency and severity. During the last six weeks he was
under observation he only had three spells, very mild in type.</p>

<p>C. R., male, aged twenty-one years. Epileptic seizures for
past three years following an injury. Had been trephined in
right parietal region before coming under our observation.
After trephining the symptom improved, but got worse again;
when seen by us was having one daily. 40-drop doses of
<i>Solanum</i> caused diarrh&#339;a, and dose was reduced to 30 drops
<i>t. i. d.</i>, when diarrh&#339;a ceased. Under this treatment he had
no spell for two weeks. In the following month he had three
spells; was then lost to observation.</p>

<p>A. N., male, aged thirty years. First spell one year ago;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 324]</span>
have since occurred every two weeks; good deal of headache.
Ordered <i>Solanum</i> 30 drops <i>t. i. d.</i> No spells for one month
and headache ceased. He then stopped attendance.</p>

<p>J. D., female, aged eighteen years. First spell when thirteen
years old; has one spell a month at the time of her menstrual
period. About a week before this period was given 40 drops
<i>t. i. d.</i>, and escaped the usual spell. The following month,
however, she had one.</p>

<p>I. K., female, aged twenty-five years. Nocturnal epilepsy
for past three years; about one spell a month. While using
40 drops <i>t. i. d.</i> went three weeks longer than usual without
a spell. The dose was then increased to 1 fluid drachm <i>t. i.
d.</i>; she then ceased her visits.</p>

<p>F. S., female, aged twelve years. First spell five weeks
ago; has been having them daily since. <i>Solanum</i> 30 drops
<i>t. i. d.</i>, ordered; this dose was gradually increased to 1
fluid drachm <i>t. i. d.</i> During the three months that she was
under observation her spells averaged in number about one a
week.</p>

<p>H. B., male, aged eighteen years. First convulsion at age
of ten years; then had none until three months ago; has had
general convulsions about once daily since. <i>Solanum</i>, 40
drops <i>t. i. d.</i>, ordered. He was only under observation nine
days, having during that time four spells, much milder in
character.</p>

<p>A. C., female, aged fifteen years. First convulsion one
year ago; they have been increasing in frequency; now has
one about every three days. During the three weeks she was
taking 30 drops of <i>Solanum</i> three times a day she had one
spell, that occurring during the third week.</p>

<p>H. K., male, aged eighteen years. First spell when fourteen
years old. Every three or four days has several attacks
in succession, an average of about one daily. While taking
<i>Solanum</i> in 40-drop&mdash;afterwards increased to teaspoonful&mdash;doses
he had twelve in thirty-eight days, an average of a little
less than one in three days, going six without having any.</p>

<h3>SPIRITUS GLANDIUM QUERCUS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>&mdash;Cupuliferæ.<br />
<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>&mdash;European or English oak.<br />
<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The spirit is destilled from the tincture prepared
by macerating the acorn kernals from the Quercus robur,
in five times their weight of dilute alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following, from Rademacher, is quoted and translated by Dr. J. C.
Burnett in his <i>Diseases of the Spleen</i>).</p></blockquote>

<p>I became acquainted with this remedy in a wonderful way.
Many years ago (I do not remember the exact time) a working
carpenter, who had previously lived at Crefeld, came to
seek my advice for his bellyache, which was of long standing.
According to his own statement, he had long been under
Sanitary Councillor Schneider in Crefeld, who was not able
to help him, and so sent him to Professor Günther in Duisberg.
Ten journeys thither were likewise in vain.</p>

<p>I tried my usual remedies for seemingly such cases, but to
no good; and as I noticed he was a good cabinetmaker, and
dabbled a bit in upholstery, I told him it would be a good
plan if he were to hire himself out to a country squire as
joiner, thinking that the food of the servants' hall would suit
his sick stomach better than the beans, black bread, and
potatoes of the master carpenter. The good fellow followed
my advice, and lived with a squire for many years; and I
heard nothing more about him. Finally, he married the
parlormaid, and settled here in this town as a joiner. One
day when visiting his sick wife I remembered the old story of
his bellyache, and wanted to know how it then was. "All
right," said he, "I have not had it for years." It seems that
a local surgeon, being one day at the squire's, told him to get
some acorns, and scrape them with a knife, and then put the
scrapings into brandy and leave them to draw for a day, and
then to drink a small glass of this spirit several times a day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
He did as he was advised, and was forthwith relieved, and
very soon entirely freed from his old trouble.</p>

<p>From what I knew of the surgeon, I was very sure he could
not give me any intelligent reason for his prescription. I
should only have heard that acorn scrapings in brandy were
good for the bellyache, or, at the most, I may have ascertained
from what doctor, or peasant, or old wife he had got
the tip.</p>

<p>But this would have done me but poor service; and as I
had in the meantime become much more cunning, I questioned
the joiner himself afresh as to the kind of his old pain,
particularly as to the part of the belly where the pain was
<i>last felt</i> when he had had a bad attack. He was in no doubt
about it, but at once pointed to the part of the belly nearest
the left hypochondrium. So I very shrewdly suspected that
the abdominal pains were really owing to a primary affection
of the spleen, in which notion I was strengthened by remembering
that the best pain-killing hepatic and enteric remedies
had done him no good.</p>

<p>To get as soon as possible to the bottom of the thing, I set
about preparing a tincture of acorns, and gave a teaspoonful
five times a day in water to an old brandy drunkard, who was
sick unto death, and of whom I knew that he had suffered
from the spleen for a very long time, the spleen being from
time to time painful. He had likewise ascites, and his legs
were dropsical as far as the knees. It occurred to me that if
the acorn tincture were to act curatively on the spleen the
consensual kidney affection and its dependent dropsy would
mend. I soon saw that I had reckoned rightly. The urinary
secretion was at once augmented, but the patient complained
that each time after taking the medicine he felt a constriction
of the chest. I ascribed this to the astringent matter of the
acorns, and thinking the really curative principle thereof
would most likely be volatile I caused the tincture to be distilled.
This acorn spirit caused no further constriction, and
the urinary secretion was still more markedly increased, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
tension in the præcordia became less and less, and this hopelessly
incurable drunkard got quite well, much to the surprise
of all who knew him, and, honestly speaking, much to my
own surprise also.</p>

<p>Having thus put the spirit of acorns to such a severe test,
and that in a case that I already knew so well, in which it
was impossible to make a mistake as to the primary affection,
I went further, and used it by degrees in all sorts of spleen
affections, and that not only in painful ones, but in painless
ones, in the evident ones, and in those of a more problematical
kind. Gradually I became convinced that it is a remedy,
the place of which no other can take. More particularly is it
of great, nay, of inestimable value in spleen-dropsy. Later
on, I found that the volatile curative principle of acorns may
be still better extracted with water with the addition of alcohol.
[The <i>aqua glandium</i> is thus prepared:&mdash;One pound of
peeled and crushed acorns to the pound of distillate.] Perhaps
water alone might extract the healing principle, but it
would not keep thus, and so the cures would be uncertain,
not to mention the fact that such-like decaying medicines are
a great trouble to the chemists. The dose of the spirituous
acorn-water (the only preparation I have used of late years) is
half a tablespoonful in water four times a day. It has not
much taste; some would even say it has none, but the doubter
may make a solution of alcohol and water in the same proportions,
and he will soon find that it has quite a taste of its
own.</p>

<p>I must make mention of two of its peculiar effects. Certain
people feel, as soon as they have taken it, a peculiar
sensation in the head, lasting hardly a minute or two, which
they say is like being drunk.</p>

<p>With a few people, particularly with those who have suffered
from old spleen engorgements, diarrh&#339;a sets in after
using it for two or three weeks that makes them feel better.
It seldom lasts more than a day, and is not weakening,
but moderate. Hence it is not needful either to stop the
acorn water or to lessen the dose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>I could add many instructive cases of spleen-dropsies and
other spleen affections in which the volatile principle of
acorns proved curative, but as I have so much more to say on
other subjects I dare not be too discursive on this one point;
besides, what I have already said will suffice for common-sense
physicians. Still I cannot forbear noticing a few bagatelles.
For instance, I have found that the acute spleen
fevers that occur intercurrently with epidemic liver fevers
are best cured with <i>aqua glandium</i>&mdash;at least that is my
experience.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I am of opinion that the three <i>splenics</i> of
which I have made mention are curative of three different
morbid states of the spleen, and I know well from my own
experience that acorns are indicated in the most common
spleen affections; and, finally, I am not acquainted with any
positive signs whereby those three separate morbid states of
spleen can with certainty be differentiated from one another.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In a later work, <i>Gout and its Cure</i>, by Burnett, the remedy is again
brought up as follows:)</p></blockquote>

<p>For some years past I have been acquainted with a remedy
that antidotes the effect of alcohol very prettily, as I will
show. I enter upon the subject in this place, because it deserves
to be widely known, and also because in the treatment
of gout, the alcoholism not infrequently bars the way. The
remedy I refer to is the distilled spirit of acorns&mdash;<i>Spiritus
glandium quercus</i>. My first account will be found in my
"Diseases of the Spleen," where <i>Spiritus glandium quercus</i> is
dealt with as a spleen medicine. I speak of set purpose of
the hom&#339;opathic antidote, because alcoholism is a disease,
and as such must be met by specific medication.</p>

<p>Some of Rademacher's patients complained to him that
while taking his acorn medicine they felt in their heads somewhat
as if they were drunk; but as Rademacher did not believe
in the law of similars&mdash;indeed, knew but little about
it&mdash;their complaint had no ulterior significance to him, but<span class="pagenum">[Pg 329]</span>
still it struck him as worthy of record. "A few, but not
many, of those who take it immediately feel a peculiar sensation
in the head, which they say is like they feel when they
are drunk, the sensation lasting only a minute or two."
Now, in the light of the hom&#339;opathic law, this symptom is
eminently suggestive, but whether any one beside myself has
ever noticed this symptom I am not aware. Rademacher had
previously related the following brilliant cure. * * *
He says that in order to get a clear idea of the action of the
remedy he caused to be prepared a tincture of acorns, of
which he gave a teaspoonful in water five times a day to an
almost moribund brandy toper, who had long been suffering
from a spleen affection that at times caused him a good deal
of pain, and who, at the time in question, had severe ascites
and whose lower extremities were dropsical up as far as the
knees. Our author was of opinion that the affection was a
primary disease of the spleen, and reasoned that if the tincture
of acorns cured the spleen the kidneys would duly resume
work and the ascitic and anasarcous state would disappear.
He soon found he was right; patient at once began to pass
more urine, but he complained that every time he took a
dose of the medicine he got a constriction about the chest,
and this Rademacher ascribed to the astringent quality of the
acorns, and to avoid this he had the tincture of acorns distilled.
The administration of this distilled preparation was
not followed by any unpleasant symptom, and the quantity of
urine passed increased still more, the tension on the præcordia
slowly lessened and this inveterate drunkard got quite well,
much to the amazement of everybody, Rademacher included,
for he did not at all expect him to recover.</p>

<p>Now, it must be admitted that a remedy that can cure an
old drunkard of general dropsy and restore him to health deserves
closer acquaintance, and when we first regard it from
the pathogenetic side as producing, of course, contingently, a
cephalic state, resembling alcoholic intoxication, and then
from the clinical side as having cured an abandoned drunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>ard,
it looks very much as if we had a remedy hom&#339;opathic
to alcoholism. I may add that Rademacher nowhere hints
that the <i>Spiritus glandium quercus</i> stands in any relation to
alcoholism; he regards it merely as a spleen medicine, specially
indicated in dropsy due to a primary spleen affection. At
first I regarded it merely in the same light, but when I really
gripped the significance of the pathogenetic symptoms just
quoted I thought we might find in our common acorns a
notable hom&#339;opathic anti-alcoholic.</p>

<p>(It is not fair to quote further from Burnett, but we may
add that in his book, <i>Gout and Its Cure</i>, there are given a
number of clinical cases in which the remedy acted brilliantly
in those addicted to tippling, or drinking hard. It is not so
much that the remedy extirpates the habit, but it enables
those afflicted to easily control their appetite and drink "like
other people," without that insatiable craving. The dose is
about ten drops in water three to four times a day.)</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following is to be found on p. 131 of Dr. Gallavardin's "Hom&#339;opathic
Treatment of Alcoholism:")</p></blockquote>

<p>"A lady, by administering, morning and evening, an infusion
of the dry leaves and flowers of Golden Rod (<i>Solidago
virga-aurea</i>) tells me that she cured her husband of an affection
of the bladder which had compelled him to use a catheter
for a year or more. A friend of Hom&#339;opathy, not a physician,
desired to test the efficaciousness of this plant. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
caused the first dilution of its tincture to be taken three times
a day by seven patients of from forty-two to seventy-four
years of age, who had been obliged to catheterize themselves
for weeks, months and years, and cured them so thoroughly
that they had no relapses. Surgeons who spend much time
in catheterizing such patients for months and years could often
cure them much more rapidly by prescribing for them the
remedy just mentioned."</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. A. E. White, <i>Hom&#339;opathic Recorder</i>, July, 1891, relates the following
case:)</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;, age 37, married, has had seven children. Came
to me December 10, 1890, with the following history: "Had
not had her menses for four months. Thought she was in a
family way. Abdomen bloated up every <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>; sick at her
stomach all of the time; frontal headache, <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>; felt better
when first getting up in the morning, at which time her abdomen
was almost normal in size.</p>

<p>"Her water she complained of more than anything else.
Had to pass it every half hour during day and several times
during night.</p>

<p>"Backache all of the time, which was not decreased by
passing water. Urine had a white, slimy deposit on standing
a short time.</p>

<p>"Requested an examination, but could not discover that
she was in a family way. Found her back very sensitive in
region of kidneys, trace of albumin in urine.</p>

<p>"I gave her a vial of <i>Solidago</i> 1x, told her to take two
disks every four hours and report in three or four days. She
came back December 13th, 'the medicine went right to the
spot.' From the second dose her water became natural and
she did not bloat so much in <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Her stomach did not
bother her any more. I gave her a bottle of <i>Puls.</i> 3x to take
with the <i>Solidago</i>, and she reported December 17th, that her
menses had come on.</p>

<p>"I have used it in several other cases where it seemed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>dicated
by the tenderness in kidney region and the inability
to control the water from whatever cause, always with perfect
satisfaction to patient and myself."</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following paper on the use of <i>Solidago virga-aurea</i> is by Dr. M.
Gucken, of Eupen, Germany:)</p></blockquote>

<p>The Golden Rod is in Hom&#339;opathy, according to my
opinion, not as much made use of as it deserves. Foh. Gottfr.
Rademacher, who has many admirers among us, says, in his
<i>Justification of Experience in Medicine</i>, about <i>Virga-aurea</i>:
"This herb is a very old and good kidney medicine. It is a
specific for kidneys, and brings the patients back to the
normal condition." I have used the Golden Rod for a long
time, and have to make favorable reports. The results of extensive
hom&#339;opathic proving of this remedy on healthy
persons cannot be found in our literature, but a Würtemburg
physician, Dr. Buck, has given us a list of cures with the
Golden Rod in the popular hom&#339;opathic paper edited by Dr.
Bolle, which wholly confirms the statements of Rademacher,
besides the cases reported by Dr. Buck.</p>

<p>According to this last, <i>Virga-aurea</i> is especially adapted for
scrofulous subjects; at the same time other constitutions do
not exclude the use of this remedy. In the first place, <i>the
condition and the action of the kidneys and the quality of their
secretions</i> are to be considered in the selection of this remedy.
The symptoms on the part of the kidneys and the urinary
organs, which point to <i>Virga-aurea</i>, are as follows:</p>

<p>Pains in the kidneys; region of kidneys painful upon pressure;
feeling of enlargement and tension in the kidneys, also
pains in the kidneys which extend forward to the abdomen
and to the bladder. Dysuria, difficult and scanty urination;
urine dark, red-brown, with thick sediment; stone and gravel,
albumen, blood or slime in the urine; urine dark, with sediments
of phosphates; slightly sour, neutral or alkaline; urine
with numerous epithelial cells or small mucous particles.
Epithelial cells with gravel of triple phosphates, or phosphate
of lime. Bright's disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 333]</span>Side symptoms which point to this remedy:</p>

<p><i>Skin.</i>&mdash;Scrofulous rash; little blotches on hands and feet,
itching very much; very obstinate, itching exanthemas; exanthema
of the lower extremities without swelling of the
inguinal glands, but with disturbance in urinating (catarrh of
the kidneys).</p>

<p><i>Sleep.</i>&mdash;Insomnia.</p>

<p><i>Fever.</i>&mdash;Rheumatic fever; very frequent pulse; high fever.</p>

<p><i>Head.</i>&mdash;Headache.</p>

<p><i>Eyes.</i>&mdash;Scrofulous, herpetic inflammation.</p>

<p><i>Ears.</i>&mdash;Sudden deafness, with ringing in the ears and albuminous
urine.</p>

<p><i>Nose.</i>&mdash;Dry; the inner surface of the nose covered with
blood crust; scalding and very scanty brown urine.</p>

<p><i>Mouth.</i>&mdash;Flat ulcers in the mouth and throat.</p>

<p><i>Gastric: Stomach, Abdomen and Stool.</i>&mdash;Continuous bitter
taste, disturbing the rest, especially nights; heavily covered
tongue, which does not become clean in spite of the use of
anti-gastric remedies, and only cleanses itself at the return of
abundant urinating; chronic catarrh of the bowels; diarrh&#339;a,
with scanty, dark urine; dysentery; costiveness; sensation of
pain in the abdomen on both sides of the navel, upon deep
pressure; physconia of the abdomen by gases; severe pricking
in both hypochondria to the region of the kidneys, reaching
to the lower extremities, with continued bitter taste in the
mouth, especially at night, with very scanty brown and sour
urine.</p>

<p><i>Female Parts.</i>&mdash;Hæmorrhage, chronic leucorrh&#339;a, in connection
with copious, watery urine and sediments of mucous
particles and uriniferous tubules; epithelium.</p>

<p><i>Respiratory Organs.</i>&mdash;Heavy expectoration in coughing;
croup, with little blotches on the hands and diminished urine;
chronic catarrh of the lungs; continuous dyspn&#339;a; periodical
asthma, with nightly dysuria.</p>

<p><i>Trunk and Lower Limbs.</i>&mdash;Rheumatism of the intercostal
muscles; chronic pains in the loins; limping, dragging gait;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
rheumatic pains in the legs; pains in the thighs; the legs
can be moved horizontally, but when moved perpendicularly
they feel lame.</p>

<p>In connection with these symptoms the description of a few
cases of sickness, in which <i>Virga-aurea</i> proved itself, might be
of some interest.</p>

<p class="center">CLINICAL.</p>

<p>During the spring of 1886 scarlet-diphtheria appeared in
this place. On March 28th I was called to attend the 8-year
old son Matthias, of Wernerus, a weaver, in the hamlet of
Niepert, that showed symptoms of the above disease.
Cynanche was at high degree, and the throat was filled with
diphtheritic coating, so much so that I had reason to fear the
worst, on account of the accompanying fever and of the
choked-up condition and weakly (scrofulous) habit of the
patient. But the well-known remedy of Viller, given alternately
with <i>Belladonna</i>, proved itself also in this case, and the
symptoms in the throat assumed, after a few days, a less
dangerous character. Not so with the fever, which gradually
assumed the form of typhoid, and ran very high, while the
scarlet-rash grew quite pale. On the morning of April 5th,
his temperature was 42.5°, the patient unconscious, the pulse
weak and intermittent, the feet swollen. Upon inquiry the
parents told me that the boy urinated very little. His urine,
of which I had taken a quantity the day previous for examination,
contained a considerable amount of albuminous
sediments. I prescribed <i>Kali arsenicosum</i> in the fourth centesimal
potency, which had been recommended in similar
cases by Dr. Hock in the international hom&#339;opathic press;
but, although the temperature decreased after using this
remedy, the dropsical swelling of the feet increased more and
more, and after a few days the entire body of the patient was
swollen very much. The discharge of urine grew continually
less. Under these circumstances I examined the patient
again thoroughly, and found great sensitiveness of the kidneys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
against pressure, in spite of his otherwise apathetic condition.
These symptoms reminded me of <i>Virga-aurea</i>. This remedy
was immediately applied, and I had no reason to regret it.
Within one day the urinal discharge became profuse, the general
condition improving at the same time; the peeling off
took place without further trouble, and after the patient had
taken <i>Virga-aurea</i> for two weeks, and, on account of anæmia,
for one week three times a day, a dose of <i>Ferrum peroxydatum</i>
in the 2d trituration, he had so far recovered that I did not
consider it necessary to give further medicine.</p>

<p>In 1885 a 45-year-old Belgian mine official (his work was
office-work) consulted me on account of sleeplessness and pain
in the back. The patient had no other complaints, only he
carelessly added it sometimes took him a long time to urinate,
because of want of the necessary pressure. He considered
this weakness as the result of gonorrh&#339;a, from which he had
suffered years ago. The sleeplessness, for which he had tried
all remedies possible, would make itself known from the time
he went to bed until 3 o'clock in the morning, at which time
he could get sleep, but not a refreshing one, and on arising
he would feel very tired, especially in the upper part of the
thighs, and then would commence the pain in the back,
which extended to the loins, and lasted until he went to bed
in the evening, without being prompted by external influences
(warmth, cold, rest, motion). Also sleeplessness nights, pain
in the back daytimes. At first I considered <i>Nux vom.</i> proper,
and I prescribed the same for the patient, in the 3d decimal
potency, four drops twice a day. At the same time I requested
the patient to bring a sample of his urine at his next
visit. After some time he came back with the sample, and declared
that the prescribed remedy had not shown the least
effect.</p>

<p>The urine was dark and slimy, reddish, slightly acid, and
had at the bottom of the bottle brick-dust settlings. Heat
did not show albumen, but by heating it the dark urine became
clearer, and contained also salts of uric acid. I ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>amined
the kidneys of the patient, found them sensitive
against pressure, and the diagnosis pointed to chronic catarrh
of the kidneys. Sleeplessness, pain in the back and the tired
feeling in the upper parts of the thigh were additional symptoms
of this malady, and I determined to use <i>Virga-aurea</i>.
The patient took this for three months three times a day,
after which he wrote me that he was entirely well. About a
year afterwards he had a relapse, but not in the form of former
symptoms, but in the form of ischias, against which disease
Golden Rod proved itself beneficial.</p>

<p>In conclusion, may be mentioned a double case of the
curative power of <i>Virga-aurea</i>, which also contributes to the
heredity of disease. Some time ago, the wife of a farmer, 53
years old, asked me for a prescription for a trouble which she
had had for twenty-six years, since her first confinement. The
patient, a stout and fresh-looking person, made the following
statement: After the confinement, which was very laborious,
and which was followed by prolapsus uteri, the latter still existing,
her legs began to swell, and an itching rash broke out
by degrees. Menstruation had always come at the proper time,
but suddenly stopped six months ago.</p>

<p>Since that time the itching had become almost intolerable,
the legs more swollen and always cold, but she did not feel a
continuous heat in her head. The appetite was very poor;
she had always a bitter taste in the mouth, and the tongue
was thickly coated. At the same time she had rising from
the stomach, as if she should suffocate, and at the least exertion
she lost her breath. She urinated very little, and this
mostly at night. My question, if there were pains in the
back, was answered in the negative, but the kidneys of this
patient were also sensitive against pressure. The appearance
of the lower limbs of the patient frightened me. From knee
to heel they formed a bluish-red mass in the shape of a stove-pipe,
which were covered with little blotches and crusts.
This kind of an eruption, together with the other symptoms,
led me to the use of <i>Virga-aurea</i>, the prolonged use of which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
although it did not affect a cure, produced a mitigation of the
whole body, so that the lady induced her eldest son to come
to me for help. This man had also trouble in his lower
limbs not unlike his mother. He had a year ago passed
through a severe throat difficulty, after which his lower limbs
began to swell and to itch; they were also tainted bluish-red
and covered with vesicles; he also complained of scanty urine,
and his kidneys were sensitive against pressure. What better
could I, under the circumstances, prescribe than <i>Virga-aurea</i>?</p>

<p>The result was good. After a few months the patient had
no more difficulty.</p>

<p>In the cases above mentioned, I prescribed the 3d decimal
dilution of the tincture of the whole plant of Golden Rod.
The water of Golden Rod, recommended by Rademacher and
others, I have never tried.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Frederick Kopp proved this remedy and the results were published in
the <i>Hom&#339;opathic World</i>, 1896, as follows:)</p></blockquote>

<p>"It has proved to me a matter of impossibility to answer
all the letters that have been sent to me by readers of the
<i>Hom&#339;opathic World</i> on the subject of the use of <i>Stellaria
media</i> in the treatment of rheumatism, but I trust that the
information given below will satisfy all the correspondents.
It will be remembered by my readers that the new drug was
first proved by me in 1893, consequent on my attention being
drawn to the weed by our esteemed friend, the Rev. F. H.
Brett. I made a thorough proving of the drug, not only once,
but several times, so as to satisfy myself beyond a doubt as to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 338]</span>
the symptoms peculiar to it, and the excruciating rheumatic-like
pains developed at the time are still vividly remembered
by me; in fact, they were so severe and intense as not to be
easily forgotten when once experienced. There is no mistaking
the <i>rheumatic</i> symptoms of the drug. They come on
very rapidly, and the sharp, darting pains so peculiar to
rheumatism are experienced, not only in almost every part of
the body, but the symptoms of soreness of the parts to the
touch, stiffness of the joints, and aggravation of the pains by
motion are also present. These pains may be described as
follows:</p>

<p>"Rheumatic-like pains over the right side of the head;
especially towards the back, with the parts sore to the touch;
rheumatic-like pains darting through the whole head, worse
on right side; rheumatic-like pains left half of forehead, over
the eye, with the parts sore to the touch; rheumatic-like pains
in the left foot; rheumatic-like pains in the ankles; sharp,
darting, rheumatic-like pains in the left knee, gradually extending
above along the thigh; rheumatic-like pains below the
right knee-cap; rheumatic-like, darting pains through various
parts of the body, especially down the right arm and the middle
and index fingers of the left hand; stiffness of the joints in
general; rheumatic-like pains in the calves of the legs, which
are sensitive to the touch; rheumatic-like pains in the right
hip; rheumatic-like pains across the small of the back, aggravated
by bending or stooping; stiffness in lumbar region with
soreness; darting, rheumatic-like pains through right thigh;
rheumatic-like pains in right groin.</p>

<p>"It will be seen by the above symptoms that almost every
part of the body in which it is possible for rheumatic pains to
occur is affected, the rheumatic-like pains darting from one
part to another. My correspondents all being readers of <i>The
Hom&#339;opathic World</i> will remember a case reported in the
January number of the journal (1896), by Mr. R. H. Bellairs,
in which the pains were 'now in ankle, now in knee, now in
arm, wrist, or fingers.' This case fully illustrates the symp<span class="pagenum">[Pg 339]</span>toms
borne out in my proving of the drug, and it but naturally
followed, according to the law of similars, that the disease
should yield to the month's treatment with <i>Stellaria
media</i>. Mr. Bellairs says he thinks that possibly 'shifting
pain' is a key-note, and I am glad that I am able to inform
him that he is correct in his supposition. I am pleased to
hear that he has often given <i>Stellaria media</i> in chronic
rheumatism, and now looks upon it as a specific. It is these
things that gladden the heart of the prover of new drugs&mdash;the
news of the practical triumph of a new drug over symptoms
of disease similar to those it is itself capable of developing
in a healthy body&mdash;and one feels amply repaid for the
hours and days of pain and suffering that one has inevitably
to put up with in the vocation of 'proving.' I heartily congratulate
Mr. Bellairs on his success in curing the above case.</p>

<p>"I have been asked by one correspondent whether a changeable
climate&mdash;one with sudden changes of temperature
occurring every day, for instance&mdash;would prevent the drug
from taking effect in the treatment of rheumatism. To this
question I can promptly return an answer in the negative.
I have proof upon proof lying before me to testify that <i>Stellaria
media</i> is just as efficacious in a changeable climate as in
any other. Reports of cases cured have come to me from
various parts of the world, under varying changes of climate,
and the result has always been the same, namely, 'the cure
of the case.'</p>

<p>"For <i>internal</i> administration I have always found the 2x
tincture the most efficacious, given in from one to two drop
doses every two, three, or four hours, according to the severity
of the symptoms. For <i>external</i> purposes I strongly advise
the &#952; tincture. It may be employed either in the form of a
lotion (20 to 60 minims of &#952; tincture to a tumblerful of
water), the ointment or the liniment (30 to 40 minims of the
&#952; tincture to &#495;j of pure olive oil). Cloths steeped in the lotion
and renewed when dry may be applied to the painful parts,
or the ointment or liniment may be rubbed well in. Ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>perience
has taught me that external treatment combined
with internal greatly assists in hastening the cure. In the
treatment of rheumatism <i>Stellaria media</i> is a very active
drug, acting very promptly; a low dilution of the mother
tincture of the drug taken internally is very apt, therefore, to
intensify the pains, and these should therefore be avoided and
the 2x dilution used."</p>

<blockquote><p>(A great deal has been published lately concerning this remedy. The
following by Dr. Dufan, <i>London Medical Record</i>, seems to give the best
outline of its uses:)</p></blockquote>

<p>1. The stigmata of maize have a very marked, though not
always a favorable, action in all affections of the bladder,
whether acute or chronic.</p>

<p>2. In acute traumatic cystitis, and also in gonorrh&#339;al cystitis,
they have a very marked diuretic action, but, at the
same time, increase the pain; hence they should not be employed
in these cases.</p>

<p>3. The best results have been obtained in cases of uric or
phosphatic gravel, of chronic cystitis, whether simple or consecutive
to gravel, and of mucous or muco-purulent catarrh.
All the symptoms of the disease, the vesical pains, the dysuria,
the excretion of sand, the ammoniacal odor, etc., rapidly disappear
under the influence of the medicine.</p>

<p>4. The retention of urine dependent on these various affections
often disappears as improvement progresses, but the use
of the sound must sometimes be continued, in order to empty
the bladder completely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>5. The stigmata maize have very often produced a cure
after all the usual internal remedies had been tried in vain,
or with only partial success. In other cases, the ordinary
methods of treatment, which had at first proved more or less
entirely useless, became efficacious after stigmata had been
administered for a time, and had, as it were, broken the
ground for them. Most frequently the stigmata alone sufficed
for the cure, but still in some cases the effect was incomplete,
and it was found that the treatment could be varied
with benefit. Injections and irrigations of the bladder also
proved useful adjuncts to the maize.</p>

<p>6. As the stigmata of maize are a very powerful, though
at the same time entirely inoffensive diuretic, they have also
been employed with the best results in cases of heart disease,
albuminuria, and other affections requiring diuretics. Cases
have been reported in which the urinary secretion was tripled
and even quintupled in the first twenty-four hours, and
others where the exhibition of the drug was continued for
two or three months without the slightest untoward effect.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Though Dr. Dufan condemns the use of the remedy in gonorrh&#339;a, other
practitioners have commended it for that very purpose. Dr. Leo Bennett,
<i>Therapeutic Gazette</i>, 1893, having had "unusual success" in the treatment
of that disease with the <i>Stigmata maidis</i>.)</p></blockquote>

<h3>SUCCINIC ACID.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;The pure chemical is triturated in the usual
way.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following is by Dr. Morris Weiner, of Baltimore, 1892:)</p></blockquote>

<p>About twelve years ago I decided to prove <i>Succinic acid</i>
(<i>Acidum succinicum</i>). <i>Agricola</i> mentions this acid, 1546, as
<i>Salt of amber</i>. <i>Boyle</i>, towards the close of the 17th century,
was the first who pronounced it to be acid, and <i>Stecker de
Neuform</i> confirmed this statement, after repeated investigations,
calling it a <i>true</i> acid. <i>Berzelius</i> published its elemental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>composition, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>This acid was long ago laid aside as obsolete, and not without
good reason, because since the Puritans in chemistry commenced
to rule over every laboratory of pharmacy, by trying
to redistill this crude acid and changing its yellowish color to
snowy whiteness, they drove out every trace of the <i>oily matter</i>
which alone constitutes its medical action. The whiter this
acid becomes the larger doses can be taken without any action
on the human system. Knowing that this <i>oil of amber</i> is
driven out totally by redistillation I was compelled to prepare
the crude acid myself.</p>

<p>The expense is considerable. One pound of amber yields
about half an ounce of crude acid, and the glass retort, after
dry distillation, must be broken to collect the acid.</p>

<p>The fumes of <i>Acidum succinicum crudum</i> are inflammable,
producing asthma, cough, sneezing, weeping, dropping of
watery mucus from the nostrils, pain in chest and headache.</p>

<p>None of our remedies gives a truer picture of hay fever, and
since the <i>oil of amber</i> must be securely inclosed in the amber
itself, it was but natural to conclude that by trituration I may
receive all the virtue of the remedy.</p>

<p>At the same time I remembered that necklaces and earrings
of amber are considered a popular protection agent against
neuralgia, colds, and even hay fever.</p>

<p>Since that time I prescribed in cases of hay fever the third
decimal trituration, one or two grains dissolved in twelve teaspoonfuls
of distilled water, one teaspoonful every two hours,
with the best results, and have cured more than thirty persons,
who were formerly obliged to go to the mountains to get
temporary relief. Already after the first week most of them
experienced decided relief.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following concerning this remedy, which dates back to Dioscorides,
we find in <i>American Journal of Hom&#339;opathy</i>, 1846:)</p></blockquote>

<p>The Hom&#339;opathic Examiner for August contains a paper
entitled "<i>Connection of Hom&#339;opathy with Surgery</i>," by <i>Croserio</i>,
translated by P. P. Wells, M. D. It is there stated that
"injuries of the bones are healed most promptly by <i>Symphytum
officinale</i> 30 internally once a day. This remedy accelerates
the consolidation of fractures surprisingly." The
translator adds a note as follows: "I have had repeated opportunities
of verifying this declaration of Croserio. A boy,
fourteen years old, broke the bones of the forearm, at the junction
of the lower and middle thirds, two years ago. He had
twice repeated the fracture by slight falls. The ends of the
fragments are now slightly movable on each other, and the
arm is weak and admits of little use. Three doses of <i>Symphytum</i>
effected a perfect cure. The lad became more robust,
and has since had better general health than ever before."</p>

<p>A boy, eight years old, fractured the humerus, near the
junction of the condyles and shaft. <i>Arnica</i> 30 immediately
arrested the spasmodic jerks of the muscles of the injured
arm. This remedy was continued the first three days, when
the traumatic fever had entirely subsided. He then had
<i>Symphyt</i>. &#658;, gtt. i., in half a tumbler of water, a teaspoonful
every morning and evening. The splints were removed the
<i>ninth day</i>, and the bone was found consolidated. The cure
was entirely without pain. How much earlier than this the
fragments ceased to be movable is not known. Well may
the author say it heals broken bones surprisingly. Let it be
remembered that the discovery of this specific is but one of
the many rich fruits of <i>Hahnemannism</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following appeared in the <i>Hom&#339;opathic World</i>, 1890, under the signature
F. H. B.:)</p></blockquote>

<p>In none of the Hom&#339;opathic treatises that I possess do I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
find any mention of the above remedy. I am surprised at
this, for I believe it to be a very valuable one in certain
cases. Its common name of <i>knitbone</i> seems to point to popular
experience of one of its uses; but I believe its knitting, or
uniting, power extends to muscular and other tissues of the
body, as well as to the bones. Let me give two instances of
my own personal experience. Many years ago I had an inguinal
rupture on each side, not extensive ones, but causing
a protrusion about the size of half a small walnut. After
wearing a truss for some time, I bethought me of what I had
heard of the uniting power of Comfrey, and made some
tincture from the root, and rubbed it in. After doing so two
or three times, the signs of rupture quite disappeared, and the
parts remained sound for about three years; when, from some
cause or other, the right side broke out again, but as it did
not give much trouble I neglected it for some time, and then
tried the Comfrey tincture again, but this time without success.
I suppose the ruptured edges had got too far asunder.
The left side, however, which originally was the worse of the
two, has kept sound ever since. I think this shows that a
rupture, if not too extensive, and if taken in time, may often
be cured by this remedy. The other case I have to relate
was of a different kind. Five weeks ago I had a fall on my
back, the whole force of which was concentrated on a small
portion of the lower spine, through the intervention of the
back pad of my truss. I thought for the moment my back
must have been broken, the pain was so excessive; and not
only the back, but diaphragm and all the organs below it
suffered acutely for three or four weeks after the fall. But a
fortnight after the fall I was for the first time conscious of a
pain and tenderness higher up the spine, at a point, I think,
where ribs commence, and on feeling I found a protuberance
there, as if a partial dislocation had taken place there. I
again thought of Comfrey, and had some of the tincture
applied. The tenderness at the point subsided after two or
three applications, and in a few days the protuberance disap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>peared.
* * * On more careful examination I find that
the point of secondary disturbance was higher up than I have
described&mdash;two or three inches higher than the first insertion
of the ribs in the spinal column.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. Gottweis, in <i>Hom. Zeitung</i>, vol. vii., says:)</p></blockquote>

<p>An old and very valuable remedy. This plant is found all
over Europe (and in some parts of North America), in wet
fields and ditches. We make a tincture out of it which has
marvelous healing and cicatrizing properties. <i>Symphytum</i>
must be a very old popular remedy; its reputation is well established,
and it is mentioned in all the old medical "tomes."
The decoction acts as an effective demulcent and pain-killer
in severe bruises. It diminishes the irritation in wounds and
ulcers, ameliorates and lessens too copious suppuration and
promotes the healing processes. In hom&#339;opathic practice
the tincture diluted with water is used with great success in
fractures and bruises or other injuries of bones. Its effect is
really extraordinary in injuries to sinews, tendons and the
periosteum.</p>

<p>A few days ago a colleague consulted me about a horse
with a stab wound in the fetlock which would not heal, do
what he would, and which rendered locomotion impossible.
(The doctor is by no means a young or inexperienced veterinarian.)
I examined the wound, and at once recommended
<i>Symphytum</i> &#952;. Within two weeks the animal was cured.
This remedy really cannot be overestimated.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. W. H. Thompson, President of Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland,
in an address reported in London <i>Lancet</i>, 1896, reports a case of which the
following is the gist:)</p></blockquote>

<p>Early in 1895 he saw a man who was suffering from a malignant
growth in the nose&mdash;"a malignant tumor of the
antrum, which had extended to the nose." An exploratory
operation confirmed this diagnosis. "He refused the larger
operation. The exploration was made by Dr. Woods. We<span class="pagenum">[Pg 346]</span>
found that the tumor did extend from the antrum, into which
I could bore my finger easily. Dr. O'Sullivan, Professor of
Pathology in Trinity College, declared the growth to be a
round-celled sarcoma. Of that there is no doubt. The tumor
returned in a couple of months, and the patient then saw Dr.
Semon, in London, who advised immediate removal. He returned
home, and after a further delay he asked to have the
operation performed. I did this in May last by the usual
method. I found the tumor occupying the whole of the
antrum. The base of the skull was everywhere infiltrated.
The tumor had passed into the right nose and perforated the
septum so as to extend into the left. It adhered to the septum
around the site of perforation. This was all removed,
leaving a hole in the septum about the size of a florin. He
went home within a fortnight. In a month the growth
showed signs of return. It bulged through the incision and
protruded upon the face. Dr. Woods saw him soon afterwards,
as I had declared by letter that a further operation
would be of no avail. The tumor had now almost closed the
right eye. It was blue, tense, firm, and lobulated, but it did
not break. Dr. Woods reported the result of his visit to me,
and we agreed as to the prognosis. Early in October the
patient walked into my study after a visit to Dr. Woods.
He looked in better health than I had ever seen him. The
tumor had completely disappeared from the face, and I could
not identify any trace of it in the mouth. He said he had no
pain of any kind. He could speak well when the opening
remaining after the removal of the hard palate was plugged,
and he was in town to have an obturator made. He has since
gone home apparently well."</p>

<p>The patient told Dr. Thompson that he had applied poultices
of <i>Comfrey</i> (or <i>Symphytum</i>) and that was all.</p>

<p>"Now this was a case of which none of us had any doubt
at all, and our first view was confirmed by the distinguished
pathologist whom I have mentioned and by our own observation
at the time of the major operation. Here, then, was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>other
'surprise.' I am satisfied as I can be of anything that
the growth was malignant and of a bad type. Of course, we
know in the history of some tumors that growth is delayed
and that in the sarcomata recurrence is often late. But this
is a case in which the recurrence occurred twice&mdash;the second
time to an extreme degree; and yet this recurrent tumor has
vanished. What has produced this atrophy and disappearance?
I do not know. I know nothing of the effects of
comfrey root, but I do not believe that it can remove a sarcomatous
tumor. Of course, the time that has so far elapsed is
very short; but the fact that this big recurrent growth no
longer exists&mdash;that it has not ulcerated or sloughed away, but
simply, with unbroken covering, disappeared&mdash;is to me one
of the greatest 'surprises' and puzzles that I have met with."</p>

<h3>SYMPHORICARPUS RACEMOSUS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Caprifoliaceæ.<br />
<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Snow Berry.<br />
<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;One part of the fresh ripe berries is macerated
in two parts by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In 1882 Dr. Edward V. Moffat read the following paper on this remedy
before the Hom&#339;opathic Medical Society of New York:)</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us go back about fifteen years and sketch a history of
this drug. At that time Prof. S. P. Burdick investigated the
medicinal of many plants hitherto unused by the profession,
among others chanced to be the snow berry, or <i>Symphoricarpus
racemosus</i>. He gave some of the drug to the first prover, an
intelligent lady, who on feeling the marked nausea, which it
soon produced, exclaimed: "Doctor, this is precisely like the
morning sickness I always experienced during pregnancy."
Dr. Burdick became more interested, repeated the experiment
with other provers, obtained almost uniform results, viz., a
feeling varying from qualmishness to intense vomiting. It<span class="pagenum">[Pg 348]</span>
was given to female provers only and merely tested far enough
to verify that symptom.</p>

<p>Upon this clue Dr. Burdick gave it in the higher potencies
to patients suffering from the vomiting of pregnancy with
most satisfactory results. Indeed, after a trial of many years,
he has found it so far superior to other remedies that he now
relies on it altogether with rarely any but entirely satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>He mentioned the drug in his course of lectures, so I bore
it in mind waiting for a test case. Soon that came in the
person of a young lady three months advanced in her first
pregnancy who was suffering from a deathly nausea, with
vomiting and retching so prolonged and violent as to produce
hæmatemesis. The smell or thought of food was repugnant
in the extreme. An examination disclosed no malposition or
apparent cause for the trouble, so I procured some <i>Symphoricarpus</i>
(200) from Dr. Burdick and gave her one dose in the
midst of a violent paroxysm. In a few minutes she stopped
vomiting and said she felt soothed and quieted all over. In
half an hour the nausea began again, but a few pellets checked
it promptly and she fell asleep. Once during the night she
awoke distressed and took a dose, but slept again quite soon.
For a month or so she felt very well until after over-exerting
herself she became nauseated once more; but it was promptly
checked, nor did it return during her pregnancy.</p>

<p>After this I had the opportunity of prescribing it in a number
of cases with such gratifying results that I gave some of
the drug to a number of physicians, requesting a faithful trial.
Among them were my father, brother, Dr. Danforth, Dr. McClelland,
of Pittsburg, and several others. All reported favorably
and some enthusiastically, and so I have been led to
bring this subject before this society. The indications as far
as I have observed them in cases of pregnancy are a feeling
of qualmishness with indifference to food. In more severe
cases, like the above, there is a deathly nausea; the vomiting
is continuous violent retching, but it covers every graduation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
between these extremes; it does not seem to be confined to
any particular <i>morning</i> aggravation; a prominent symptom is
the disgust at the sight, smell or thought of food. One case
I remember where the patient was comparatively comfortable
while lying on the back, but would be nauseated by the
slightest motion of the arms, particularly raising them. The
case was completely relieved by a few doses. And so the

<p>Thinking that if the irritation of pregnancy were thus
subdued, that of menstruation might be as well, I have given
it repeatedly in such cases of nausea or vomiting just before,
during or after catamenia, with admirable results.</p>

<h3>TELA ARANEARUM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Names</span>, Spider's Web, Cobweb.<br />
<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Triturate in the usual way.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following paper is by Dr. S. A. Jones, it was published in the
<i>American Observer</i>, 1876):</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Gillespie, of Edinburgh, "cured an obstinate intermittent
with cobweb after other means had failed." Dr. Robert
Jackson was led from this to try it himself. He told his success
to Dr. Chapman, of Philadelphia, who requested one of
his pupils, Dr. Broughton, to investigate the subject, which
he did, and wrote his Inaugural Thesis thereon in 1818.
From these and other authorities we can gather enough testimony
to show that it is well worth while to make a systematic
proving of this animal product, thereby predicating
its sphere and precisioning its employment.</p>

<p>In a work on fevers&mdash;which particular edition I have not
been able to consult&mdash;Dr. Jackson writes: "I think I may
venture to say that it prevents the recurrence of febrile
paroxysms more abruptly, and more effectually, than bark or
arsenic, or any other remedy employed for that purpose with<span class="pagenum">[Pg 350]</span>
which I am acquainted: that, like all other remedies of the
kind, it is only effectual as applied under a certain condition
of habit; <i>but that the condition of susceptibility for cobweb is
at the same time of more latitude than for any other of the
known remedies</i>."</p>

<p>If we bear in mind Grauvogl's constitution-classification of
<i>Diadema aranea</i> as an hydrogenoid remedy, and recall how
generally the hydrogenoid constitution is induced by intermittent
fever, we shall be ready to acknowledge the truth of
the passage which I have placed in italics, and with this
evidence of a truthful beginning we shall be more ready to
accept the subsequent testimony.</p>

<p>"If the cobweb," continues Dr. Jackson, "was given in
the time of perfect intermission, the return of paroxysm was
prevented; if given under the first symptoms of a commencing
paroxysm, the symptoms were suppressed, and the course
of the paroxysm was so much interrupted that the disease,
for the most part, lost its characteristic symptoms. If it was
not given until the paroxysm was advanced in progress the
symptoms of irritation, viz.: tremors, startings, spasms, and
delirium, if such existed as forms of febrile action, were
usually reduced in violence, sometimes entirely removed. In
this case sleep, calm and refreshing, usually followed the
sudden and perfect removal of pain and irritation. Vomiting,
spasms, and twisting in the bowels, appearing as modes
of febrile irritation, were also usually allayed by it; there
was no effect from it where the vomiting or pain was connected
with real inflammation or progress to disorganization."</p>

<p>"In cases of febrile depression, deficient animation, or indifference
to surrounding objects, the exhibition of eight or
ten grains of cobweb was often followed by exhilaration: the
eyes sparkled; the countenance assumed a temporary animation,
and, though the course of the disease might not be
changed, or the danger averted, more respite was obtained
than is gotten from wine, opium, or anything else within my
knowledge."<span class="pagenum">[Pg 351]</span></p>

<p>"In spasmodic affections of various kinds, in asthma, in
periodic headaches, in general restlessness and muscular
irritabilities its good effects are often signal. The cobweb
gives sleep, but not by narcotic power;&mdash;tranquillity and
sleep here appear to be the simple consequence of release
from pain and irritation."</p>

<p>"The changes induced on the existing state of the system,
as the effect of its operation, characterize it as powerfully
stimulant: 1. Where the pulses of the arteries are quick,
irregular, and irritated, they become calm, regular, and slow,
almost instantaneously after the cobweb has passed into the
stomach: the effect is moreover accompanied, for the most
part, with perspiration and perfect relaxation of the surface.
2. When the pulses are slow, regular, and nearly
natural they usually become frequent, small, irregular, sometimes
intermitting. 3. When languor and depression characterize
the disease, sensations of warmth and comfort are diffused
about the stomach, and increased animation is conspicuous
in the appearance of the eye and countenance."</p>

<p>Dr. J. likewise "effected perfect cures with it in some
troublesome spasmodic affections, and gave it with the most
marked benefit in dry, irritating coughs, usually termed
nervous. In the advanced stage of phthisis it procured a
respite beyond his expectation. He also found it useful in
restraining a troublesome hiccough."</p>

<p>Remembering the fame of <i>Mygale avicularia</i> in chorea we
may well expect this other spider to be of use "in some
troublesome <i>spasmodic</i> affections."</p>

<p>Dr. Chapman writes of it: "I have cured some obstinate
intermittents, suspended the paroxysms of hectic, overcome
morbid vigilance from excessive nervous mobility, and quieted
irritation of the system from other causes, and particularly as
connected with protracted coughs and other chronic pectoral
affections. * * * * Some consider it as highly stimulant, invigorating
the force of the pulse, increasing the temperature
of the surface, and heightening excitement generally&mdash;others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
witnessing no such effects, are disposed to assort it with those
remedies which seem to do good <i>chiefly by soothing the agitations
of the system</i>. I confess that I concur in the latter
view of its properties."</p>

<p>How unconsciously the Philistines of Old Physic bear testimony
to the truth of our therapeutic law. Given where
"heightened excitement" obtained, Chapman saw it "do
good chiefly by soothing the agitations of the system," and
to him, of course, cobweb was a sedative.</p>

<p>Dr. Broughton, in his Thesis, says: "In all the cases of
disease in which I have seen or heard of the exhibition of the
web, no sensible, or at least no uniform, operation could be
observed. Some patients were sensible of none, others of a
slight sudorific, and some a nauseatic effect; and one or two
thought it proved cathartic after remaining in the system for
the space of twelve or fifteen hours. These accounts being
so incorrect and various, I determined to ascertain (if possible)
the correct operation by giving the web to healthy
persons."</p>

<p>"I found from these experiments that the operation of the
web appeared principally to be upon the arterial system; and
perhaps in less time than any article already known: the
force and frequency of the pulse being uniformly reduced in
some cases ten, in others fifteen strokes in a minute; and in
one case, the pulse, from being strong and full, became soft,
small, and very compressible; all which operation took place
within the space of two hours, after which time the artery
gradually regained its former force and frequency. This has
been the only invariable effect I could observe, all others
appearing but anomalous."</p>

<p>Dr. Thacher cites the following case from a paper of Dr.
Jackson's: "W. Sands has been afflicted for many years with
a distressing asthma, which has proved fatal to his father and
two sisters. The complaint being hereditary, and aggravated
by malformation of the thorax, no remedy gave any permanent
relief, nor did change of climate procure any allevia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>tion
of symptoms. For a considerable time back he has
never been able to lie down in bed on account of a sense of
suffocation, but is obliged to be supported half sitting by
pillows, and is seldom able to sleep. He swallowed nearly a
scruple of the spider's web, he swallowed it at bed time, and
to his utter astonishment enjoyed sound and uninterrupted
sleep all night; a blessing to which he had been an entire
stranger above six years. Since he began with the cobweb
thinks his health is improved; the cough has certainly
abated, but whenever the remedy is omitted the complaint
returns."</p>

<p>Dr. Oliver found that "by the use of this remedy a patient
laboring under organic disease of the heart and hydrothorax
obtained great relief and refreshing sleep, who had not before
slept for three nights. Another, under similar affection, experienced
uncommon relief from the same prescription. To
one suffering much pain from cancer it afforded ease and
comfortable sleep. A patient in phthisis pulmonalis being
affected with distressing agitation of mind and nervous irritation,
it answered like a charm, and soon induced great
sleep like a moderate dose of opium."</p>

<h3>THALLIUM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Triturate the pure metal in the usual way.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following is from the <i>Hom&#339;opathic World</i>, 1893):</p></blockquote>

<p>In the "French News" column of the <i>Chemist and Druggist</i>
we came across a note on the effect of <i>Thallium</i>, which
we have no doubt hom&#339;opaths will soon turn to good account.
Here is the paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curious Effect of a Remedy.</span></p>

<p>"Dr. Huchard read a paper at the last meeting of the
Paris Academy of Medicine on <i>Acetate of Thallium</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
was formerly advocated by Dr. Combemale, of Lille, as a
medicament against profuse perspiration in certain cases of
serious illness. It appears, however, that its useful influence
is counterbalanced by the fact that it causes the hair to fall
off with great rapidity. Dr. Huchard exhibited at the meeting
several photographs of patients who had become quite
bald in several days. He was consequently very emphatic
against the use of the remedy."</p>

<p>There is all the difference between the two schools in this
note. To the allopath this is a "curious effect" merely, and
serves to condemn the drug. To the hom&#339;opathic it brings
to light a new remedy for a troublesome affection which is
by no means too well provided for.</p>

<p><i>Thallium</i> is a rare metal, whose atomic weight is 204.2, its
symbol being Tl. It receives its name (&#952;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#972;&#987;, a green shoot)
from the green line it gives on the spectrum, through which
it was discovered by Crookes in the residuum left from the
distillation of selenium. <i>Thallium</i> has a bluish white tint
and the lustre of lead; is so soft that it can be scratched by
the finger nail. Specific gravity, 11.8. It belongs to the
lead group of metals, but has peculiar reactions of its own.
It is used in the manufacture of glass of high refractive
power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Cruciferæ.<br />
<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Shepherd's Purse.<br />
<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;Three parts of the fresh plant in flower are
macerated in two parts by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following paper on this remedy is by Dr. E. R. Dudgeon and appeared
in the <i>Monthly Hom&#339;opathic Review</i>, 1888):</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>Art Médical</i>, for July, 1888, contains a paper on this
plant by Dr. Imbert Gourbeyre, displaying all his well-known
ability and erudition. Although an unproved remedy, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
sphere of specific action is pretty accurately known, and in
former days it was frequently employed by many eminent
medical authorities. In our own days, though almost unknown
to "scientific" medicine, it enjoys a considerable reputation
in popular medicine, chiefly for hæmorrhages, and
profuse menstruation, and metrorrhagia.</p>

<p>According to Dioscorides, it is emmenagogue and abortive,
anti-hæmorrhagic, and a remedy for sciatica. In Salmon's
<i>Doren Medicum</i> (1683) it is said: "The seed provokes urine
and the courses, kills the <i>f&#339;tus</i>, resists poyson, breaks inward
apostems, and, being taken in &#495;ij, it purges cholera." In
Vogel's <i>Historia Materiæ Medicæ</i> we read of the seed:
"Ischiaticis infusum prodesse, et menses ciere (Dioscorides).
Sudorem pellere, et ad scorbutum posse, si eb vius teratur,
adiecto saccharo (B&#339;rhaav)." It was called by the old herbalists
<i>sanguinaria</i>&mdash;"quia sanguinem sistet." Murray, at the
end of last century, pronounced it useless; but De Maza,
arguing against this opinion, relates a case of metrorrhagia
cured by it, applied as a cataplasm to the loins, on the recommendation
of an old woman, after the doctor had tried several
medicines without effect. Lejeune (1822) says he has
seen good results from its employment in hæmoptysis.</p>

<p>Rademacher has a great opinion of it. He says: "This
plant was held to be an anti-hæmorrhagic medicine by the
ancients. The superior wisdom of later physicians has pronounced
it to have no such power, <i>because it contains no
astringent principle</i>! (Carheuser's <i>Mat. Med.</i>) A second
property attributed to it was that of stopping diarrh&#339;a; a
third, that of cutting short agues. I have lately used it repeatedly
in chronic diarrh&#339;a, when this is purely a primary
affection of the bowels, with surprising benefit; but it is useless
in consensual diarrh&#339;a. I have not yet used it in ague,
but would not dissuade others from trying it. But the most
important remedial power of this common innocuous plant I
learned from no medical author; the knowledge of it was
actually forced upon me by the following case: I was called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
to see a poor woman from whom, eight or ten years before, I
had brought away a large quantity of urinary sand by means
of magnesia and cochineal, and thereby cured her. Now, the
tiresome sand had again accumulated in the kidneys, and the
patient was in a pitiable state. The abdominal cavity was
full of water, the lower extremities swollen by &#339;dema, and
the urine of a bright red color, which formed, on standing, a
sediment unmistakably of blood. I prescribed tincture of
<i>Brusa pastoris</i>, 30 drops, 5 times a day, solely with the intention
of stopping the hæmaturia as a preliminary; but
imagine my astonishment when I found that the tincture
caused a more copious discharge of renal sand than I had
ever witnessed. Paracelsus's words occurred to me: 'A physician
should overlook nothing; he should look down before
him like a maiden, and he will find at his feet a more valuable
treasure for all diseases than India, Egypt, Greece or
Barbary can furnish.' I should certainly have been a careless
fool had I, with this striking effect before me, changed
to another medicine. I continued to give the tincture; I saw
the urinary secretion increase with the copious discharge of
sand; the water disappeared from the abdomen and extremities,
and health was restored. I went on with the tincture
until no more sand appeared in the urine, and I had
every reason to suppose that the deposit of sand was completely
removed. Since then I have used this remedy in so
many cases with success that I can conscientiously recommend
it to my colleagues as a most reliable remedy. Among
these cases was one which appeared to me very striking. It
was that of a woman, aged 30, who came to me for a complication
of diseases. I examined the urine for sand, but
found none. I gave her the tincture of <i>Brusa pastoris</i>, and a
quantity of sand came away. On continuing the tincture
much more sand came away, and her other morbid symptoms
disappeared."</p>

<p>It was stated some time ago that Mattei's <i>anti-angioitico</i>
was a tincture of <i>Thlaspi bursa pastoris</i>, but, if we are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
credit the statement of a periodical lately published, entitled
<i>General Review of Electro-Hom&#339;opathic Medicine</i>, this is not
so, for <i>anti-angioitico</i> is there stated to be a medicine
compounded of <i>Aconite</i>, <i>Belladonna</i>, <i>Nux vomica</i>, <i>Veratrum
album</i>, and <i>Ferrum metallicum</i>. I mention this inadvertently,
but I do not suppose it is of much consequence, and my first
experience of the remedial action of <i>Thlaspi</i> was anterior to
the information that it was one of Mattei's remedies.</p>

<p>In the 3d volume of the <i>British Journal of Hom&#339;opathy</i>,
page 63, there is an observation taken from the Berlin <i>Med.
Zeit.</i>, to the effect that Dr. Lange found the greatest benefit
from "a decoction of the whole plant in cases of passive
hæmorrhage generally, and especially in too frequent and too
copious menstruation." In the <i>Zeitsch. f. Erfahrungsheild.</i>,
the periodical published by the followers of Rademacher, Dr.
Kinil relates the case of a woman who, three weeks after
accouchement, was affected with strangury. She could not
retain her urine, which dribbled away, drop by drop, with
constant pain in the urethra. The urine was turbid and had
a deep red sediment. She got 30 drops of the <i>tincture of
Thlaspi</i> five times a day. The strangury disappeared at once,
the urine could be retained after a few days, and after eight
days it became clear and without sediment.</p>

<p>Dr. Hannon (<i>Presse Med. Belge</i>, 1853) mentions that he had
found <i>Thlaspi</i> very useful in hæmorrhage when the blood
was poor in fibrine. Dr. Heer (Berlin <i>Med. Zeit.</i>, 1857) found
<i>Thlaspi</i> efficacious in the dysuria of old persons, when the
passage of the urine is painful and there is at the same time
spasmodic retention of it. On giving the medicine, a large
quantity of white or red sand is discharged, and the troublesome
symptoms disappear. Dr. Joussett (<i>Bull. de la Soc.
Hom. de France</i>, 1866) had a case of hæmorrhage, after miscarriage,
at three months. He tried <i>Sabina</i>, <i>Secale</i>, <i>Crocus</i>,
tampons soaked in chloride of iron, but all in vain. He consulted
Dr. Tessier, who recommended him to try <i>Thlaspi</i>, 20
drops of the mother tincture in a draught; at the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
spoonful the hæmorrhage ceased. He found it useful in
hæmorrhage with severe uterine colic, with clots of blood, in
that following miscarriage, in the metrorrhagias at the
menopause, and in those associated with cancer of the neck
of the uterus. He found good effects from the dilutions in
some of these cases. Dr. Jousset, in his <i>Elements de Med.
Prat.</i>, repeats his recommendation of <i>Thlaspi</i> in hæmorrhages.</p>

<p>My own experience of <i>Thlaspi</i> is very small. In one case
Dr. Rafinesque, of Paris, cleverly "wiped my eye," to use a
sporting term, with this medicine. A young French widow
was treated by me for a severe attack of jaundice, from which
she made a good recovery. But after this she suffered for a
couple of months from a very peculiar discharge after the
catamenial flux. It had the appearance of brownish, grumous
blood, and was attended with obscure abdominal pains. The
cervix uteri was swollen and soft, but not ulcerated. I tried
and tried to stop this discharge, but without success. She
went back to Paris and put herself under the care of Dr.
Rafinesque, who was her ordinary medical attendant. He
tried several different medicines without any effect on the discharge.
At last he gave <i>Thlaspi</i>, 6th dilution, and this had
an immediate good effect. Afterwards he gave the mother
tincture, 10 drops in 200 grms. of water, by spoonfuls, and
again in the 6th dilution, and after keeping her on this medicine
for some weeks the discharge was completely cured.
The full details of the case will be found in the <i>Brit. Journ.
of Hom.</i>, vol. 32, p. 370.</p>

<p>One other case I have had illustrative of its action in the
presence of excessive quantities of uric acid in the urine: A
lady, æt 76, was under my care for a very curious affection.
She had considerable rheumatic muscular pains in various
parts, and constant profuse perspirations day and night.
Along with this she had the most abundant secretion of uric
acid, which passed away with every discharge of urine. Sometimes
the uric acid formed small calculi, which gave much
pain in their passage down the ureter, but it generally ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>peared
in the form of coarse sand, which formed a thick layer
at the bottom of the utensil. This sand continued to pass after
the cessation of the sweats and rheumatic pains, which lasted
six or seven weeks. I tried various remedies&mdash;<i>Pulsatilla</i>, <i>Picric
acid</i>, <i>Lycopodium</i>, etc., but without effect. At last I bethought
me of Rademacher's recommendation of <i>Thlaspi</i>, and after a
few doses of the 1st dilution the sand diminished very much,
and, indeed, sometimes disappeared altogether, and when it
did return, it was in insignificant quantity.</p>

<p>On the whole, I think this medicine deserves a thorough
and complete proving. It is evidently a powerful anti-hæmorrhagic,
and its influence on the urinary organs, more
particularly in bringing away and in curing excess of uric
acid in the urine, is very remarkable.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere mentioned the power of this substance to
affect the secretion of uric acid, and then I have seen several
cases corroborative of its medicinal virtues in this direction.
One, a gentleman, æt. 57, who, in addition to other dyspeptic
symptoms, had occasionally large discharges of coarse uric
acid, coming away in masses the size of a good big pin's
head, but curiously enough without pain. I prescribed
<i>Thlaspi</i>, which he said soon stopped the uric acid. Nearly a
year after this he called on me for a different affection, and
informed me that the uric acid had reappeared several times
in his urine, but that a few doses of <i>Thlaspi</i> 1 stopped it, and
it never came to the height it attained when I first gave it to
him. A lady, nearly eighty years of age, was suffering from
the pressure of a calculus in the left ureter, which I knew to
be of uric acid, as she had previously passed much 'sand.'
The urine showed no sand, and was very scanty. I tried
several remedies, among the rest the Borocitrate of magnesia,
but it was not till I gave <i>Thlaspi</i> 1 that a great discharge of
coarse brick-colored sand took place, with speedy relief to
her pain. At the same time, indeed, I made her drink
copiously of distilled water, which has a powerfully disintegrating
effect on uric acid sometimes, but, as she had al<span class="pagenum">[Pg 360]</span>ready
been taking this for several days without effect, I am
inclined to give the whole credit of the cure to <i>Thlaspi</i>.</p>

<p>It is not alone in such cases that <i>Thlaspi</i> is useful. Its
ancient use as a hæmostatic has been confirmed in modern
times and in my own experience, and my friend, Dr. Harper,
related to me lately a most interesting cure he had effected
by its means of a very prolonged and serious affection. The
case was that of an elderly lady who for years had suffered
from a large discharge of muco-pus, sometimes mixed with
blood, sometimes apparently nearly all blood, which poured
from the bowels after each evacuation. She had been many
months under the medical treatment of the late Dr. D. Wilson,
who at last told her he considered her disease incurable.
She then put herself under the treatment of a practitioner
who relies chiefly on oxygen gas for his cures; but she was
no better&mdash;rather worse&mdash;after his treatment. She then came
to Dr. Harper, who worked away at her with all the ordinary
remedies without doing a bit of good. At last he bethought
him of <i>Thlaspi</i>, led thereto by my remarks on its anti-hæmorrhagic
properties in my "therapeutic notes" in <i>The
Monthly Hom&#339;opathic Review</i> of October, 1888, and he found
that, from the time she commenced using this remedy, the
discharge from the bowels gradually declined and ultimately
ceased, and there has been no return of it.</p>

<p>No doubt <i>Thlaspi</i> is a great remedy, and until it is
satisfactorily proved, we may employ it with advantage in
cases similar to those I have mentioned. But it is to be
hoped that some of our colleagues endowed with youth, health
and zeal, will ere long favor us with a good proving of it,
whereby its curative powers may be precisionized. At present
we only partially know these from the less satisfactory results
of clinical experience.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following is from a paper by Dr. Millie J. Chapman in Transactions
of American Institute of Hom&#339;opathy, 1897:)</p></blockquote>

<p>The provings are brief and do not furnish very full indications
for its use. However, from them we learn of its ef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>fectiveness
in expelling accumulations of sand and uric-acid
crystals from the kidneys and bladder, also in controlling
hemorrhage from the nose, kidneys, or uterus.</p>

<p>My attention was first called to this remedy in cases of sub-involution
following either abortion or labor at full term,
where it many a time induced recovery.</p>

<p>I have since witnessed equal success in hemorrhage from
uterine fibroid where the flow was controlled, and the growth
was greatly reduced in size before the age of the individual
would naturally produce these changes. Also uterine hemorrhage,
attended with cramps and expulsion of clots, has been
relieved by it after curetting had failed.</p>

<p>A member of the Women's Provers' Association took five
drops of the tincture three times a day for ten days. This
was followed by a great increase of urine and a menstrual
flow lasting fifteen days. She became alarmed and could not
be persuaded to continue the proving.</p>

<p>Another took ten drops, three times a day, for five days,
when the quantity of urine and brick dust deposit were so
unusual that her interest in scientific investigation suddenly
ceased.</p>

<p>About a year since, there came for treatment a patient who
had suffered long from both disease and treatment of the
bladder. <i>Thlaspi</i> 2x and later five drop doses of the tincture
expelled great quantities of sand, and was followed by complete
relief of the bladder symptoms and the disappearance of
rheumatic pains that had been supposed incurable.</p>

<p>Another case of similar bladder irritation and marked evidences
of gout was promptly relieved.</p>

<p><i>Thlaspi</i> also has a reputation in the cure of urethritis.</p>

<h3>THYROID.</h3>

<p>The <i>Thyroid</i>, especially if used continually or in large

<p>1. Elevation of the temperature.</p>

<p>2. Increase of the heart's action and of the frequency and
volume of the pulse, which, however, is more compressible.
Walking, even standing, after taking a dose is apt to cause a
feeling of faintness and even complete syncope. The heart
may become so weak that it cannot endure any overexertion
without danger, even death may result.</p>

<p>3. Shortness of breath.</p>

<p>4. Increase or decrease of appetite, sometimes nausea, less
frequently vomiting, still less diarrh&#339;a.</p>

<p>5. Improvement in body nutrition generally, more complete
absorption of nitrogenous food. But later on nitrogen is excreted
in excess of that taken in the food.</p>

<p>6. Loss of weight.</p>

<p>7. Increase of sexual desire.</p>

<p>8. Menses profuse, prolonged or more frequent, rarely
amenorrh&#339;a.</p>

<p>9. Increased activity of the mucous membrane, kidneys
and skin, which becomes moist and oily, sometimes exfoliation
of the epidermis.</p>

<p>10. Rapid growth of the skeleton in the young with softening
and bending of those bones which have to bear weight.</p>

<p>11. A disease closely resembling exophthalmic goitre. A
cataleptic improved under large doses of <i>Thyroid</i>, but when
the dose of 75 grs. a day was reached symptoms like those of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 363]</span>
exophthalmic goitre developed with a pulse of 160, but no
glandular swelling. When the <i>Thyroid</i> was discontinued the
catalepsy grew worse, the exophthalmic goitre better; when
resumed the catalepsy better, the exophthalmic goitre worse.</p>

<p>A patient, while under <i>Thyroid</i> treatment for myx&#339;dema,
took, through a misunderstanding, in eleven days nearly 3
ounces of the dessicated <i>Thyroid</i>, whereupon tachycardia,
pyrexia, insomnia, tremor of the limbs, polyuria, albuminuria,
and glucosuria, in short, a disease similar to exophthalmic
goitre developed.</p>

<p><i>Thyroid</i> has been <i>used</i> with benefit in the following <i>diseases</i>:</p>

<p>1. Arrested development in children, cretinism, idiotism.</p>

<p>2. Myx&#339;dema. [The extirpation of the entire <i>Thyroid</i>
produces a disease resembling myx&#339;dema.]</p>

<p>3. Simple goitre.</p>

<p>4. Excessive obesity with tendency to weakness and
anæmia.</p>

<p>5. Melancholia functional insanity, where improvement
has taken place up to a certain point and then remains so.</p>

<p>6. Defective secretion of milk during lactation when connected
with reappearance of menses. <i>Thyroid</i> will suppress
the latter and increase and enrich the milk.</p>

<p>7. In fractures of the bones in which consolidation does
not promptly occur.</p>

<p>8. Hypertrophy of cicatricial tissue resembling keloid, possibly
true keloid.</p>

<p><i>Doses:</i> Either the fresh gland of the sheep prepared like
food or the extract, or in the dessicated state, of the latter
may be given from 2-3 grs., or more or less, once a day (at
night) or oftener.</p>

<p>The <i>Thyroid</i> is <i>contra-indicated</i> in tuberculous persons, as
they are apt to lose quickly in weight, over two pounds in
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Rheumatic and anæmic symptoms are more frequently aggravated
than improved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>As the <i>Thyroid</i> is a powerful remedy, the following should
be always remembered:</p>

<p>There is a decided difference with regard to individual
toleration, some are very susceptible.</p>

<p>The pulse should be watched regarding frequency and
quality. The least effort or exertion will increase it even to
160, hence some cases should be kept in bed or at least very
quiet and tranquil even for a time after the remedy has been
discontinued. Deaths have taken place after a few days'
treatment.</p>

<p>If <i>Thyroid</i> is not taken for myx&#339;dema the patient should
be weighed at least every two weeks, and if pathogenetic
symptoms, called thyroidism, appear the remedy should be
discontinued or reduced.</p>

<p>If softening of the bones has been caused it may be necessary
to restrict the use of the legs or to use splints.</p>

<p><i>Thyroid</i> seems to have a cumulative effect.</p>

<p>In many cases a liberal diet should be prescribed to avoid
injurious consequences.</p>

<h3>TRYCHOSANTHES DIOICA.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Cucurbitaceæ.<br />
<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Patal.<br />
<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;One part of the entire fresh plant is macerated
in two parts by weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(In 1893 H. L. Saha, hom&#339;opathic practitioner, Pabna, Bengal, sent the
following to <i>Hom. Recorder</i>:)</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Trychosanthes dioica</i> (Bengali name, Patal). It belongs to
the order of <i>Cucurbitaeæ</i>, is a creeper, flowering in all seasons,
but chiefly in spring. It is a native of Bengal. Its fruit is
called Patal, and is used by the natives as one of their chief
curry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>The plant and its root are used by the native physicians in
various maladies. Its action is mainly upon the liver and intestines.
The decoction of the root is generally used by the
mother physicians for removing costiveness, especially where
there is a derangement of the functions of the liver.</p>

<p>A boy of fourteen years of age, who had habitual constipation,
took, at the advice of a quack native physician, about
three or four ounces of the decoction of its root, which produced
profuse diarrh&#339;a. After four or five stools I was called.
I saw him weak and dejected, using abusive language to his
native physician. His face was very pale. Stools were
profuse, frequent, gushing, yellowish, watery. Much pain
and cutting about the umbilicus during and before stool.
After every stool he felt dizziness of the brain. This case
struck me that <i>Trychosanthes dioica</i> will prove a grand
remedy for diarrh&#339;a. I prepared its tincture from the root
and used it in 3x potency, in some cases with great satisfaction.
The following cases will show its curative power:</p>

<p>1. A girl, aged 6 years, was attacked with diarrh&#339;a; stools
were profuse, thin, yellowish, watery, mixed with little white
mucous; very offensive smell; cutting pain about umbilicus
during and after stool. Pain in liver and eyes; jaundice; face
yellowish; very weak; did not wish to answer questions: sad
and peevish. On the fifth day I was called. I prescribed
<i>Trychosanthes dioica</i> 3x every three hours. I saw the patient
much better next day. Within a day or two the patient
was all right.</p>

<p>2. A boy, aged 16 years, suffering from chronic diarrh&#339;a;
passed from four to five stools in a day. The character of
the stool was yellowish, watery, mixed with a little white
and greenish mucus. Smell offensive; dull, aching pain in
the region of the liver. Face very pale; eyes jaundiced. He
was very sad and dejected. His appetite little; taste bitter. He
had been at first treated by an allopath, then, afterwards, by
a hom&#339;opath. The latter showed some improvement. I was
called on the thirteenth day, when I noticed the above symp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>toms.
I prescribed <i>Trychosanthes</i> 3x every four hours. The
patient was completely cured within four days.</p>

<p>I cured some cases of choleric diarrh&#339;a by this medicine,
but those cases were vaguely reported to me.</p>

<p>I hope that, when proven, <i>Trychosanthes dioica</i> will show
its large sphere of action and give our Materia Medica a new
remedy for looseness of bowels.</p>

<blockquote><p>(This appeared in No. 284 of the <i>U. S. Med. Investigator</i> signed "&mdash;&mdash; M.
D."):</p></blockquote>

<p>In March, 1878, I was cutting wood. I cut down a soft
maple; the top was well loaded with moss. It attracted my
attention; I viewed it closely. I ate a little, about the size
of a hickory nut, as I trimmed up my tree. My head began
to ache. I cut off one log, and had to go to the house. I
could feel the blood press to the brain. My wife worked
over me, and I got to sleep. Next morning felt well; never
felt better. I did not think of the moss I had eaten. I went
on a visit and was gone five days. On my return I went to
my tree. The first sight of it reminded me of my headache.</p>

<p>I gathered some of the moss and made a tincture. I soon
had a case of headache to try my remedy on; it stopped at
once.</p>

<p>In the fall, about September, a load of young folks came
to pick cranberries. Two of the young ladies had headache
from riding in the hot sun. Both took to the lounge. Now
for my remedy. I put one drop of tincture in a goblet of
water, gave a teaspoonful; ordered another in fifteen minutes.
The second dose stopped the pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>A young married lady came on a visit to a relative&mdash;was
having pains in her head. I was sent for; found her wild
with pain. She said she had been subject to headache for
five years; had got tired of doctoring. Gave her one drop
in a cup of water, teaspoonful in twenty minutes; no more
pain. I put ten drops in a two-drachm vial of alcohol, directed
her to take one drop when she felt her headache coming
on. One year after she wrote her friend it had cured
headache; sent thanks to me.</p>

<p>I could give many more cases where the pain is over the
entire head, or front head, with a feeling as if the temples
would burst or the eyes would burst out of their sockets.
I have always used the tincture. I have not noticed any
other effect from it; would like to see a proving.</p>

<blockquote><p>(An extract from a paper by Dr. J. N. White, Queen City, Texas, detailing
at length the case of a five-year-old boy, who, after six weeks of whooping
cough, developed epileptic symptoms, having as high as twelve spasms
in twenty-four hours. After two months of treatment with such remedies as
<i>Solanum Car.</i>, <i>Sulphonal</i>, <i>Hyoscyamus</i>, <i>Cannabis Ind.</i>, <i>Calomel</i>, <i>Zinc</i>,
etc., with no results, the case was given <i>Verbena hastata</i>. Another doctor
was in consultation and we quote:)</p></blockquote>

<p>I told my friend (the Doctor) that when he became satisfied
with the zinc treatment I wanted to try another eclectic remedy.
(The Doctor was an allopath.) He was perfectly
willing and I put him on <i>Verbena hastata</i>, 12 minims every
four hours, skipping the dose at midnight. After we both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
took the case we decided, as there were no curative properties
in the sulfonal, we would drop it, and not use anything to
control the paroxysms, and consequently the boy seemed to
get worse to the parents, as he would have several falling
spells a day. From the first dose of the <i>Verbena hastata</i> the
boy began to improve. He would have contractions of the
muscles of the arms and legs and look wild for a minute or
more for the first week, but after that he never had another
symptom. We kept him on the medicine, as above, for six
weeks, and now he takes twelve drops three times a day.</p>

<p>He has not had any symptom in over two months, and all
that wild vacant look is gone, and he plays, eats, sleeps, etc.,
as if he had never been troubled with epilepsy.</p>

<h3>VISCUM ALBUM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat. Ord.</span>, Loranthaceæ.<br />
<span class="smcap">Common Name</span>, Mistletoe.<br />
<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;One part of the fresh leaves and berries is
macerated in twice its weight of alcohol.</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following account of this ancient remedy was published in the
<i>Allgemeine Hom. Zeitung</i>, 1886:)</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Grand Universal Panacea of the old Gauls and Germans.</i>&mdash;By
<i>Dr. v. Gerstel</i>, of Regensburg.&mdash;This parasite
shrub belongs to the 22d class, Linné, is found on various
trees, and was prized above all others as a healing remedy
in the Gallic and German antiquity. The Druids&mdash;their
priests&mdash;were at the same time naturalists, metaphysicians,
doctors and sorcerers, and to the mistletoe growing on oaks
were ascribed, above all other plants, marvelous healing powers.
That the oak mistletoe was prized above all those growing
on fruit or other trees, as a remedy, may be due to the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
that in ancient times all oaks and oak groves were regarded
with a holy veneration, being considered the favorite abodes
of the old German deities. The mistletoe growing on oaks
was therefore venerated by the ancient Gauls and Germans as
the holiest of heaven-sent gifts to mankind. It was applied
in all diseases, and without it no religious service could be
conducted. From the Germanic mythology we know that as
a priest&mdash;a Druid&mdash;discovered a mistletoe growing on an oak,
he at once called up all the brethren of his order of the neighborhood.
They doffed the many-colored garments in daily
use, and donned flowing white robes as a sign of humility in
the presence of the divine plant. The highest in rank approached
the tree provided with a golden sickle, bent his
knees, and was then lifted by his companions on high until
he could reach the plant. This was then cut with the golden
sickle and prepared and preserved for sacred and for healing
purposes.</p>

<p>If it could be secured six days after the new moon, the
most exhalted healing properties were attributed to it, and
it was at once made into a potion which, mixed with the
blood of steers that had never done any work and which had
been immolated beneath the oaks, formed a draught which
brought blessings, fruitfulness, health and prosperity to all
who could partake of it.</p>

<p>As at that time, and for a long time after, the origin and
propagation of the parasitic plant was unknown, it was surrounded
with a magic halo, and by virtue of its undoubted
healing qualities, especially in gout, rheumatism, nerve pains
of various kinds, neuralgias, especially of the rheumatic and
gouty variety, as well as of its close affinity with and influence
upon the female sexual system, it was accorded the
highest rank among all remedies by the Priestesses, the
female Druids.</p>

<p>About the year 1857-58, I passed one year in the town of
Steger, in upper Austria, as physician to Prince Lamberg;
there I became well acquainted with Dr. W. Huber, at the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 370]</span>
time physician to the Hom&#339;opathic Hospital of the "Sisters
of Mercy," and found in him also an antiquary of considerable
learning. His researches brought to his notice in what
high veneration the mistletoe was held by the ancient Germans
and Gauls and its employment as a universal healing
remedy. Dr. Huber, who was a man of unusual intelligence
and of high scientific acquirements, desired to learn the true
sphere of action of this important remedy, and preparing a
mother-tincture from the mistletoe&mdash;<i>lege artis</i>&mdash;he proved the
several dilutions on himself and others, men and women, thus
truly following the example of Hahnemann and his disciples.
I still possess some of this identical tincture as prepared by
Dr. Huber, who, I am grieved to say, died suddenly of
apoplexy during my sojourn, in the year 1858.</p>

<p>Dr. Huber carefully collated all the symptoms experienced
by his provers; he had a great predilection for the mistletoe,
which he prescribed in many different ailments. He frequently
conversed with me about its healing properties, and
often gave it in his hospital and in his private practice. He
used it chiefly in the 3d and 6th decimal dilution. According
to Dr. Huber, the symptoms of <i>Viscum album</i> are
similar to those of <i>Aconite</i>, <i>Bryonia</i>, <i>Pulsatilla</i>, <i>Rhododendron</i>,
<i>Rhus</i> and <i>Spigelia</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, are in accord with our foremost
anti-arthritic and anti-rheumatic remedies. <i>Viscum</i> has
symptoms in common with each of these remedies, and is
thus particularly useful in gouty and rheumatic complaints,
in acute as well as in chronic cases; more particularly
in those having <i>tearing pains</i> in no matter what part of the
body. It follows well after <i>Aconite</i> in acute rheumatism. It
is also very effective in different neuralgias of a gouty or
rheumatic origin, as in ischias, prosopalgia, periostitis, and
especially in earache, tearing pains in the ears, and otitis. It
is a sovereign remedy in rheumatic deafness. As <i>causa
excitans</i> of diseases amenable to it may be regarded high
winds, <i>i.e.</i>, all gouty, rheumatic or other ailments which,
similarly to <i>Rhus</i> and <i>Rhododendron</i>, are aggravated by sharp<span class="pagenum">[Pg 371]</span>
north or northwest winds, such as we have in winter. For
this reason <i>Viscum</i> is more often applicable in the colder season
than in summer, or at time when gouty or rheumatic
affections or pains are usually aggravated. It has also been
found beneficial in asthmatic complaints if connected with
gout or rheumatism.</p>

<p>The mistletoe moreover stands in a peculiarly close relation
to the female sexual system (uterus), and especially
to the climacteric period, when women cease to menstruate
and chronic or periodical hæmorrhages are often met with.
<i>Viscum</i> also promotes labor pains similarly to <i>Pulsatilla</i> and
<i>Secale</i>, and is especially efficient in effecting the expulsion of
the placenta, also in incarcerated placenta.</p>

<p>When the great army of gouty and rheumatic ailments
which may befall all parts of the body are taken into consideration,
as well as the manifold sufferings originating in
the female sexual system, which manifest themselves as
menorrhagias as well as amenorrh&#339;a, but more often are
caused by congestive states,&mdash;when we consider the powerful
influence of the mistletoe on these forms of diseases as
brought out by the careful hom&#339;opathic provings on the
healthy, is it to be marvelled at that the old Gauls and Germans
venerated it, by whose mysterious origin they were
overawed, as a sovereign remedy for their ailments and sufferings,
as a sacred gift presented by the gods of mankind?</p>

<blockquote><p>(The following clinical case is from <i>Hom. World</i>, 1876, by Dr. Ivatts:)</p></blockquote>

has continued quite free from the rheumatic pains since
November.</p>

<blockquote><p>(Dr. E. M. Holland wrote as follows concerning the remedy, <i>Medical
Summary</i>, 1898:)</p></blockquote>

<p>My first case of child birth in which I used <i>Mistletoe</i>
(<i>Viscum album</i>) was May 30, 1897. Was called to see Mrs.
C.; second confinement; there was but little advancement;
I sent the husband to my office, three blocks away, for some
<i>Mistletoe</i>, and I gave the lady half a teaspoonful with a
swallow of water every twenty minutes, and before one hour
had passed labor was on in good shape, and in half an hour
longer all was over.</p>

<p>I returned to my office, and in less than half an hour I
was called to see a colored woman, much of a lady, mother of
two children; on examination I found only a slight advancement
of the child, mouth of the womb but little dilated. I
learned that she had been just about the same for twelve
hours. I prepared a mixture and ordered a teaspoonful every
twenty minutes; this dose contained 30 drops of the <i>Mistletoe</i>.
I was not well, and returned to my office, leaving instructions
to notify me when labor was well on; my office
was four blocks from her residence. I reclined on a lounge,
intending to return in about an hour, but dropped into a doze,
and in about one and a half hours the husband came on the
run, notwithstanding they had sent a little girl for me. He
reached my office panting, and exclaimed: 'For God's sake,
hurry, for her insides have all come out.' On my arrival, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
found the child and afterbirth all in a pile. The confusion
was soon calmed down by the assurance that all was well.</p>

<p>Soon after this I was called to see Mrs. M., the mother of
seven children. I had been with her in six of the seven confinements,
and knowing that she had always been tedious I
gave the messenger a small vial of the same mixture and
same dose, labelled it teaspoonful every twenty minutes,
stating that I would be there in an hour or two, and I was;
but the child was born about fifteen minutes before.</p>

<p>On the 14th day of July of the present year I was called
to attend Mrs. B. in her third labor, some two miles in the
country. I left home at 3:30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> When I arrived at the
house I found nothing to indicate that I would be permitted
to return home sooner than&mdash;I will say a number of hours.
I found presentation all right, some dilatation, but there was
but little advancement. The pains seemed to be of excruciating
character, but not the kind to do more than
wear the patient out. She told me that the same kind of
pains had been on for a day and night, so I continued with
the <i>Mistletoe</i> in half-teaspoonful doses every twenty minutes.
Pains came on; in just one hour her extreme agony ceased.
Labor came on, and in half an hour more the child was
born.</p>

<p>In all these cases the placenta came readily and everything
progressed well after birth. I said I left my office at
3:30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and I was at home again by 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> It may be
that four cases are not sufficient to decide on the merits of a
remedy, but the change was so decided and prompt that I am
satisfactorily convinced that in <i>Mistletoe</i> we have an oxytocic
that is superior to all remedies hitherto tried.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>After the foregoing was compiled, Dr. George Black's exceedingly
interesting brochure of 79 pages, <i>Viscum album, the
Common Mistletoe</i>, etc., etc., appeared, and anyone wanting a
complete history of the drug should procure a copy.</p>

<p>Dr. Black (Torquay, England) publishes all the known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
provings, and in addition some very thorough ones conducted
by himself; from these we select the following striking
symptoms:</p>

<p>Proll experienced a sensation as if a large spider were
crawling over his hands; a glow rising from feet to head, and
he seemed to be on fire, though his face was pale, this repeatedly;
also violent aching pain in right foot recurring
frequently. Proving with the tincture in increasing doses up
to 40 drops.</p>

<p>Two women took the drug to produce abortion; every
muscle of the body was paralyzed, including bowels, save
those of the eye, and both died on the 8th and 9th day,
starved to death.</p>

<p>The provings by Dr. Black. A well-built woman, aged
twenty, took repeated doses of the drug from &#952; up to 30th.
The most striking symptoms were: Sudden, severe thumps of
the heart that then went on beating at a tremendous rate; it
slowed down and was followed by trembling in the limbs;
after this was very marked jerking of the limbs, and twitching;
hot feeling, though not actually hot. "A feeling as if
I should bite some one if I did not keep my teeth clenched.
A wretched feeling as if I should do something awfully
wrong if I did not keep myself under control." Several
months later the effect of the drug was still strongly in
evidence; "thinks she will go out of her mind, feels as if she
would have an epileptic fit, says she would feel far happier in
an asylum."</p>

<p>A second prover, Mrs.&mdash;&mdash; æt 37, experienced jerking and
twitchings of the muscles, shooting pains in left ovarian
region, and, on movement, lumbar pain and stiffness. Proving
made with 3d dilution.</p>

<p>Third prover, æt 27, a woman. First marked symptom
was a shooting pain in left ovary; then pain and twitching
in leg, when aching stopped it felt very hot; aching repeated,
and only relief was shifting the position of the leg to a cool
place in the bed; again a dreadful pain in the region of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 375]</span>
left ovary&mdash;"a fearful aching" "it was a pain you couldn't
have put up with long without doing something;" later: "I
have had no pain, but a great twitching in my hands and legs
for a long time, just like a person with chorea&mdash;first my left
hand jumped, then both legs, my heart seemed to beat very
fast." "When hands were held it seemed to alleviate the
jerking and twitching." The pain in ovaries, also in other
parts of the body at times, the twitchings and jerkings, and
the frequent hot feeling continued during all the proving. It
was made with the 3d and &#952;.</p>

<p>The fourth proving was made by Dr. Black himself, chiefly
with the 3x and &#952;.</p>

<p>This proving is quite long. From it we note the following
symptoms: Severe pain in right shoulder joint. Muscular
twitching in right leg. Dull pain under left false ribs.
Neuralgic pain in sciatic nerve. Back, lumbar region, stiff
and weak. Pain in right knee joint, painful to move and
tender to the touch. Weight and oppression of the heart,
with gripping feeling as if a hand were squeezing it; the load
seemed to lift, with great relief, but came back again. A
curious sensation of tickling about the heart. Twinges of
pain in the great toes. The last record some days after ceasing
the proving reads as follows: "I think it was the same
night as the previously recorded symptoms that I went to bed
between 12 and 1 o'clock, and after lying down experienced
a curious general tremor through my body, as if all the muscles
were in a state of fibrillary contraction; not a single involuntary
jerk, nor the continued twitching of the muscle or
a portion of one, but a general state affecting the whole body.
It lasted until I fell asleep."</p>

<p>Therapeutically the drug has been used for palsy, "incompetency
and tumultuous distressing cardiac action," mitral
disease, chorea, epilepsy, retention of placenta, catarrhal deafness,
menorrhagia, sciatica, rheumatism, periostitis, hydrothorax,
and transient deafness.</p>

<p>The Druids sweepingly asserted that it would "heal all

<h3>WYETHIA HELENIOIDES.</h3>

<span class="smcap">Preparation.</span>&mdash;One part of the fresh root is macerated in two

<blockquote><p>(The following, by Dr. J. M. Selfridge, Oakland, Cal., was published in
<i>Pacific Coast Journal of Hom&#339;opathy</i>, April, 1899:)</p></blockquote>

<p>There is probably no State in the Union where there is a
greater number of valuable remedies to be found than in the
State of California. These remedies are waiting to be proved
by those of us who have sufficient enthusiasm and who are
willing to take the trouble and make what sacrifice is necessary
to accomplish so desirable a result. I know it has been
said that we have too many remedies which have not been
properly proven. While this is doubtless true, it is equally
true that many of the new remedies which have been introduced
within the memory of some of us are absolutely indispensable
in the treatment of certain forms of disease.</p>

<p>There is another reason why these California remedies
should become a part of our armamentarium. It is claimed
by Teste and others that where certain forms of disease prevail
there, or in that vicinity, the curative remedy may be
found.</p>

<p>Again, it has been said that there is a remedy somewhere
in nature for every ill to which flesh is heir.</p>

<p>Whether this be true or not, we know there are certain diseases,
which, so far as we are aware, are incurable, for the
simple reason that we know of no remedy that will control
the abnormal conditions. This being true, the incentive
ought to be sufficiently great to urge us forward in the line
of knowing more than we now know of the wealth of those
remedies that lie at our very doors. All we know of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
drugs, so far, are mere hints which have been given us by the
older inhabitants of the Coast.</p>

<p>Thus, the <i>Eriodictyon Californicum</i> or "Yerba Santa," has
been suggested for the cure of "poison oak" and for certain
bronchial affections. A partial proving of it was made some
years ago under the supervision of the late Dr. Pease, which
can be found in "Allen's Encyclopædia," Vol. iv., page 218.</p>

<p>The <i>Micromeria Douglassi</i>, or "Yerba Bueno," is another
plant which should be proved. Many years ago a friend of
mine was suffering with a series of boils, when an old
"Spanish woman" directed him to make a tea of this plant.
This he did, and cured his boils; but, as the tea had an
agreeable taste, he continued to drink it, believing, as some
do, "that if little was good, more was better," until finally
he became so weak he could not continue his work.</p>

<p>It was one of these hints that induced me some years ago
to make a proving of <i>Wyethia Helenioides</i>, or "poison
weed." Like many other provings, it was only partial. A
schema of it was published in "Allen's Encyclopædia," Vol.
x., page 168.</p>

<p>Two years ago an attempt was made to secure additional
symptoms, which are given below in the language of the
provers, who at that time were members of the "Organon
and Materia Medica Club of the Bay Cities."</p>

<p>At the time of the proving, the potency and the drug were
unknown to the provers.</p>

<p>I. "June 9th, 1896, began taking&mdash;&mdash;, of which I took a
drop in a teaspoonful of water before each meal. First dose

severely; 9:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, mouth feels dry and as if scalded, with
desire to drink frequently in order to moisten it.</p>

<p>"June 9th.&mdash;Scalded mouth continues.</p>

<p>"June 12th.&mdash;6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, lips feel scalded and swollen.</p>

<p>"June 17th.&mdash;Itching in rectum.</p>

<p>"July 7th.&mdash;A sore hang-nail on third finger of right
hand.</p>

<p class="quotsig">(Signed)<br /> "<span class="smcap">A. McNeil.</span>"</p>

<p>Dr. McNeil took the first decimal dilution. (S.)</p>

<p>II. "June 5th.&mdash;Began at 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, taking a drop before
each meal.</p>

<p>"June 6th.&mdash;Depressed all forenoon, languid feeling of
mind and body; despondent almost to desperation; irritable,
cross, easily angered about trifles; melancholy about the
future, with no reason for it; seemed that I was forsaken by
all my friends and was on the verge of insanity; bodily uneasiness,
unfitting me for any work; felt that I could 'fall all
down in a heap;' muscles seemed to refuse to respond to the
will.</p>

<p>"June 7th.&mdash;Entire incapacity for mental work; could not
follow a line of thought twenty seconds; forehead cold to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 379]</span>

and flesh of forehead would come down over the eyes; intense
drowsiness all day, worse after meals; irresistible sleepiness
after lunch; accustomed cup of coffee was not relished.</p>

<p>"June 8th.&mdash;Dreams were vivid and real; was discovered
talking in my sleep; the thoughts and work of previous day
were on my mind on waking as though I had not gone to
sleep.</p>

<p>"June 9th and 10th.&mdash;Aversion to company, did not wish
to see anyone, not even intimate friends; great aversion to
my work; had to punish myself to even visit a patient;
quarrelsome, impatient, irritable.</p>

<p class="quotsig">"<span class="smcap">M. F. Underwood.</span>"</p>

<p>Dr. Underwood took the fifteenth decimal dilution. (S.)</p>

<p>III. "June 8th, 1896, commenced taking remedy given
by Dr. Selfridge, one drop three times a day before meals.</p>

<p>"June 13th.&mdash;After a restless night, awakened at 7:30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
with severe, sharp pain in the right tonsil; throat felt
swollen and sore; tonsil red and inflamed; glands on right
side of neck swollen and sore to touch.</p>

<p>"At 9:30, neuralgic pains commenced in left arm and hand,
then in back, limbs and all over the body; skin felt sore to
touch; was quite ill all day, with no appetite whatever.</p>

<p>"At 7:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> commenced to feel chilly; upon the slightest
movement chills would creep up the back, with increase
of pain; grew colder and colder; was very ill, and went to
bed. At 9:30 fever commenced with desire for food; head
very hot; cheeks very red and burning; temperature 102°,
but still very chilly. Passed a very restless night, with chill,
fever and sweat all at the same time, with constant twinges
of pain all over the body, particularly in back and limbs;
could not bear the slightest touch.</p>

<p>"June 14th.&mdash;Temperature 101-1/2° at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Right tonsil
and glands of neck still very sore, in fact, worse; pains
over body less, though back quite sore and lame; felt very
weak and unable to remain out of bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 380]</span>"Still continued the remedy. All symptoms gradually
improved, and was entirely well in a few days.</p>

<p>"June 20th.&mdash;Stopped taking the remedy on advice of Dr.
Selfridge.</p>

<p>"June 21st.&mdash;Very depressed, both mentally and physically;
menses commenced at 2:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, with slight uterine
pain. Retired at 10 o'clock, when the pain became intense
and burning. Suffered all night, the pain being constant,
though increasing in paroxysms with sensation as if the
uterus expanded in order to keep all the pain within its walls.
Could distinctly outline the contour of the uterus. Never
had such a pain before.</p>

<p>"June 22nd.&mdash;Pain much better, but still a paroxysm every
little while. Felt very weak all day and mentally depressed.</p>

<p>"When menses ceased, observed no further symptoms.</p>

<p>"July 4th.&mdash;Commenced the remedy again.</p>

<p>"July 18th.&mdash;At 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> commenced to feel chilly, with
aching pains all over the body, which gradually grew worse
until 12 o'clock, when a most severe chill took place; shook
all over; aching over body and headache intense. Took no
more of the remedy; went to bed, and as I was growing
worse, was given <i>Aconite</i> at 1 o'clock. There was great
thirst for ice water during the entire chill, which lasted until
2:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, when fever came on; temperature, 101°; no
thirst. In about fifteen minutes commenced to sweat. Temperature
at 4 o'clock 100°; still sweating. At 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
menses commenced; no uterine pain, but still aching all
over body which continued all night, preventing sleep; pains
worse in limbs and back; at times jerking in character, making
me start with every twinge; profuse sweating all night.</p>

<p>"July 19th.&mdash;Very weak; aching still continued, but less;
cords of neck, right side, quite painful. Passed a restless
night, still sweating profusely.</p>

<p>"July 20th.&mdash;Much better, but still very weak; some aching
and sweating; did not go to sleep until 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>; was
nervous and restless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 381]</span>"July 21st.&mdash;Much improved in every way, and was all
right in a day or two. Did not take any more of the remedy.</p>

<p>"July 26th.&mdash;At 1:30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> commenced to feel chilly, with
intense headache and aching all over the body. The chilliness
rapidly increased until at 2 o'clock had a worse chill
than ever, which lasted until 4 o'clock, when fever came on,
temperature soon reaching 103°; sweating commenced almost
simultaneously with the fever; headache was the most prominent
symptom, which was terrific; intense, congestive headache;
eyes extremely sensitive; bones of the face sensitive
to touch; could not move the head a hair's breadth without
intense agony; thought I should go mad from the intensity
of the pain. This lasted until 10:30, when there was a sensation
of faintness, due evidently to lack of food, and which
passed away after eating some cream toast; the headache
then also began to grow less, and I passed a fairly good night.</p>

<p>"July 27th.&mdash;Was much better, but was too nervous to
remain in bed; felt very weak all day; retired early, but did
not sleep a moment all night long.</p>

<p>"July 28th.&mdash;Arose at 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>; was weak and dizzy all
day; had to lie down every little while. Slept well this
night.</p>

<p>"Have been fairly well ever since. (August 7, 1896.)</p>

Produced by Bryan Ness, Pat McCoy and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This book was
produced from scanned images of public domain material
from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
